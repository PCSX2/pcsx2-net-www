## Setup

### Windows

Setup Scoop as per instructions at https://scoop.sh/.

Open Powershell and install the following.

```bash
scoop install git nodejs
npm install --global yarn
```

Navigate to your local git repository for the site and use the below to start the server.

To start the server you will need to be in your Github repository that contains the `package.json`.

```bash
yarn start # alternatively, you can use `npm run start`
```

Browse to http://localhost:8080/

### Linux

TODO - but very similar just using your package manager of choice

## Developing

- The docusaurus documentation is very useful and has plenty of examples https://docusaurus.io/docs
- Docusaurus uses React and JSX, seek out related resources for those if editing the frontend code

### Making a new Article

Run the following to setup the boilerplate for a new article:

```bash
yarn new-article
```

The article will go into `/blog/<year>/<title>`

You should add an image to serve as a preview (if appropriate) by using the `image:` frontmatter field, for example:

```yaml
---
title: ...
---
image: ./img/my-cool-thumbnail.webp
---
```

#### Caveats if Migrating a Legacy Article

- When running the command above, you should provide an alias that matches the relative URL from the old website. This will prevent legacy links from becoming dead. See existing articles that have been migrated for an example.
