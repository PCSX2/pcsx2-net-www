# Nightly Build Usage Guide

## Windows
- Extract  the `.7z` file wherever you'd like.  It's recommend to avoid `Program Files` however!
  - You can get 7zip from https://www.7-zip.org/download.html

## Linux (AppImage)
- You will likely have to make the AppImage file executable. There are a few ways to do this:
  - Right-click and make it executable
  - In a terminal, run `chmod +x <path-to-AppImage-file>`
- You should be able to open the file like any other application.
