Happy New Year to everyone from the PCSX2 team, we wish you the best for
the new year, with lots of PCSX2 gaming playing your favorite classics

Onto the news!

A bit later than expected , here is the Q3 & Q4 2017 progress report.

Of course there are other changes not mentioned in the report as well so
progress is still moving along

Here are the highlighted changes that we hope will strike your fancy

<PCSX2PRLink authors="RedPanda4552" prNums="2067">
  PSX:Memory card support
</PCSX2PRLink>

OriginallyPSX memory card creation was not possible through the emulator
and games could not see when a memory card was inserted. In addition, a
hack has been added that allows PCSX2 to "view" PSX memory cards as a
Pocketstation to fix compatibility with certain PSX games such as Final
Fantasy VIII. More details on that addition can be found
[here](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/pull/2208)!

This change adds/enhances the following additions:

- Adds a checkbox to the memory card creation screen allowing PSX cards to be created, as well as the logic for writing in tothe empty card.
- Modifying the existing preprocessor based SIO interrupts to instead work based on the running game's type (PSX/PS2). This allows PS2 games to skip the delays as they were before, but for PSX games to use the delays, which are necessary for memory card interaction.

# GSdx Enhancements

<PCSX2PRLink authors="lightningterror" prNums="2145">
  Extend{" "}
</PCSX2PRLink>

This hack allows for the "Preload Frame Data" (that is currently present in the OpenGL renderer) to be used in D3D renderers. It is used to fix various effects that are currently broken or not rendered properly in D3D renderers.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="lightningterror" prNums="2086">
  Frame Buffer Conversion hack
</PCSX2PRLink>

This hack enables 4-bit and 8-bit textures to be converted on the CPU instead of the GPU. It will fix glitches in games that use these types of textures.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="lightningterror" prNums="2099">
  Automatic Mipmapping option
</PCSX2PRLink>

This option enables automatic mipmapping on the hardware render if a game is pre configured to use mipmapping in the code.

# GUI Changes and Enhancements

<PCSX2PRLink authors="ssakash" prNums="1934">
  Always ask when booting
</PCSX2PRLink>

When enabled, this
option opens the file explorer to directly select the ISO at each boot
instance instead of relying on the Recent ISO list.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="gregory38" prNums="2000">
  Adaptive Vsync support
</PCSX2PRLink>

Adaptive Vsync support and
GUI optionhave been added to PCSX2 for OpenGL render to further help
with screen tearing.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="ssakash" prNums="2003">
  Restore Defaults button to GS
</PCSX2PRLink>

Added Restore Defaults button to
the GS panel of Emulation settings dialog.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="RedPanda4552" prNums="2080">
  Clear ISO list option
</PCSX2PRLink>

This option will clear
the cached ISOs (Recent ISO list) that were used in the past. Should
help with reducing clutter on large lists.
