title: PCSX2 1.2.0 Released!
---

It has been a year and a half since our first major release and as
promised we decided PCSX2 has progressed enough for yet another stable
release. Needless to say, we have been continuing our hard work since
then to further improve the emulator, adding new features and fixing
more bugs.

As I'm sure many of you have been following the SVN revisions and have
noticed the changes we have made in this time and many of you even
assisted in finding problems for us to fix, so a big thank you to all
those who helped out!

One big change in this release is the integration of the wide screen
patches made by the community for the community numbering nearly 1200
games patched to support proper 16:9 aspect ratio. A huge thanks to
everyone who has contributed for this and keep up the great job
