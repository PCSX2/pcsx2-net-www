Nearly 6 months after PCSX2 2.4.0 release, we are excited to unveil PCSX2 2.6.0! We're even more excited to showcase the things that we have been working on.

<!--truncate-->

## <TextGradient startColor="#2A6DFF" endColor="#245DD9">New Year - New Build</TextGradient>

Now that the dust has settled down from [our biggest single release to date](../../2024/pcsx2-2-release/index.mdx), we decided to step back a bit and give more love and attention to the interface, Quality of Life features and Accessibility. There are also more performance improvements to be seen, which we are very excited to show you! Our contributors have been hard at work further refining the foundation that has been laid out since 2.0.0 to make PCSX2 more accessible to everyone!

  ### Better Feature Parity Between Big Picture Mode and Qt Interface
</PCSX2PRLink>

SternXD has been on a mission to achieve feature parity between Big Picture Mode and the Qt interface. Thanks to his work, you can now adjust Network & HDD Settings, create a Memory Card, as well as login to RetroAchievements directly from Big Picture Mode!

#### New icon for RetroAchievements Qt login dialog ([#13718](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/pull/13718))

Alongside Big Picture Mode getting a new RetroAchievements login dialog, Qt's login dialog also gets a small facelift! It now shows the actual RetroAchievements icon instead of a generic login icon.

  ### Korean Game Titles
</PCSX2PRLink>

Despite having nearly 700 known NTSC-K serials, the GameDB has for a long time only had Latin versions of the titles. These titles were pulled from the NTSC-U/PAL name or from a Romaji version of the Japanese name. PCSX2 now has 100% complete Korean translation [on our Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/pcsx2-emulator) (at the time of writing), so this has been a long time coming. TheTechnician27 has been working on adding Korean game titles to most NTSC-K serials which did not previously have them.

:::note
If you have spotted any inaccuracies with the Korean game titles, please report such problem on [our GitHub issue](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/issues).

  ### Emoji Support for Big Picture Mode
</PCSX2PRLink>

Allows emojis to be shown in Big Picture Mode and the fullscreen pause menu. RetroAchievements popups would often use emojis; these are now able to render as well.

Not all emojis are supported; this is a limitation of ImGui, the library we use for this.

For the longest time, our Big Picture Mode UI was unable to display emoji due to limitations with [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui). This was especially apparent when displaying emojis from certain RetroAchievements sets. Thanks to [ImGui fixes](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/8465) and AirGamer's efforts, we have finally implemented emoji support in PCSX2's Big Picture Mode.

On a more technical level, previous version of ImGui required us to provide ranges of characters we needed. ImGui would then generate a font atlas from this. This required that we either hardcode, or generate these ranges for any languages we support in PCSX2. With ImGui 1.9.21, we can now rely on ImGui to dynamically adjust its font atlas on its own, removing the maintenance burden of fixed character ranges.

#### Big Picture Mode Icon Refresh

Big Picture Mode just got a small facelift! You might have noticed inconsistencies where some options had an icon while others did not. Now, every settings entry has an icon to go along with it.

Additionally, we can add emoji as icon too! 🔥

  ### GS/Direct3D12: Added Feedback Reads Support
</PCSX2PRLink>

Upon looking through the Direct3D12 documentation, it was found that aliased resources (two resources sharing the same memory) could be used to bind the same texture as both a shader resource and render target.
This relies on the two resources being able to inherit data from each other, the requirements of which can be satisfied using simultaneous access textures.

This allows us to speed the Direct3D12 renderer up substantially, with some systems seeing over 5x improvements on specific games.

<BarChart chartDataUrl={require("./charts/Chart-gameperf-pt2.yaml").default} />

While NVIDIA and Intel Arc GPUs had no issues, lightningterror discovered that some AMD GPUs showed issues. While the Direct3D12 documentation implies that data inheritance should work even with undefined memory layouts, the texture layout needed to be specified for some generations of AMD GPUs. Once this issue was identified it was fortunately an easy fix to implement.

While reviewing the code, lightningterror spotted and fixed a regression with handling stencil DATE one.

There have also been other enhancements to the hardware renderer where games such as Enthusia gained a significant 9% improvement in Direct3D11.

  ### GS/Direct3D11/12: Support Multidraw Framebuffer Copy
</PCSX2PRLink>

Add implementation for Multidraw Framebuffer Copy for Software Blending, Framebuffer Masking, Software Destination Alpha Testing. In order to replicate the current behaviour on our more accurate renderers such as Vulkan and OpenGL without the use of Texture Barriers, LightningTerror discovered that we can achieve the same accuracy with the use of Texture Copies albeit at a slightly higher performance cost compared to using barriers which Direct3D11 doesn't support. Direct3D12 does and such implementation is already implemented later on by AirGamer.

To give a bit of context why we need copies/barriers, it is because a texture cannot be bound at the same time as a render target view and shader resource view, a copy is created from the same render target so we can have two separate textures with the same data instead of using the same one which is a hazard, Vulkan and OpenGL use texture barriers that nullifies the need for a copy which allows one texture to be used for both.

To alleviate some of the performance hit, we later on added some optimizations which will be mentioned in the report.

To keep it short this makes Direct3D11/12 as accurate as Vulkan and OpenGL.

Anyway moving on some eye candy for those looking for visuals, it will be almost impossible to post all the fixes games since there are a lot, and we mean a lot so here's just a few:

  ### GS/Direct3D11/12: Implement Depth Testing and Sampling
</PCSX2PRLink>

Similar to our issue with software blending, our old implementation for depth testing and sampling used copies for Direct3D11/12 to avoid the texture binding hazards being bound as a depth stencil view and shader resource view at the same time. However when we use a depth texture if we are not writing anything to the depth buffer in the case where both the source and destination texture are the same we can bind them at the same time:

- In Direct3D11's case we create and bind a new read-only depth stencil view, simultaneously also binding the same texture and binding it as a shader resource view which allows us sampling depth in the shader, but no writing to the depth buffer which is unnecessary.

- In Direct3D12's case we just transition the texture to be read only which also allows us to bind it both as a depth stencil view and shader resource view at the same time.

Some eye candy showing the difference in cutting off the texture copies that we previously used:

  ### GS: Texture Copies and Barriers Optimizations
</PCSX2PRLink>

In [#13276](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/pull/13276) and [#13298](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/pull/13298) following the implementation of software blending on Direct3D11 LightningTerror decided to improve the function itself that deals with texture copies, some optimizations that were previously not present on OpenGL, Direct3D11 and Metal were backported from Direct3D12 and Vulkan which reduces the number of copies in some specific scenarios, and aborting invalid copies. This gave us a small boost in some games that used texture copies regardless of renderers as copies were required.

<Image src={require("./img/benches/13276-BoF-pt1.webp").default} />

<Image src={require("./img/benches/13276-MTV-pt2.webp").default} />

Afterwards in [#13305](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/pull/13305) some ideas were floating around how to further improve copies/barriers so TJnotJT decided to take on the task, the improvements are as follows:

1. To unify and batch triangle primitives, this allows us to reduce the number of copies/barriers per draw.

2. When doing texture copies, we only need to copy the region that we need to copy, not the entire draw. This makes texture copies faster and use less VRAM on Direct3D11/12.

#### Why this is faster?

- Example #1: In the first case batching means instead of issuing 5 copies/barriers for 5 triangles separately we can batch all 5 if they don't overlap each other and issue only 1 copy/barrier which is much faster.

- Example #2: In the second case where we only need to copy the region we are effectively reducing the copy area that we need to copy, the smaller the area we need to copy the faster it is.

<Image src={require("./img/benches/13354-CODFH-pt3.webp").default} />

Next up in [#13354](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/pull/13354), TJnotJT also implemented another improvement which detects triangles-are-quads in primitive overlap which further reduces copies/barriers on all renderers:

1. Added utility functions for detecting when vertices form axis-aligned right triangles or quads.
2. Updated primitive overlap detection to account for pairs of triangles that together form axis-aligned quads.

#### But wait there's more!

A while back, we added extra barriers to fix some bugs in Time Crisis. In [#13595](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/pull/13595) TellowKrinkle discovered that those barriers were getting added on all GPU vendors. Upon further inspection, it appears as an NVIDIA driver bug, rather than actual issues with our OpenGL API usage. This allowed us to cut down the barriers on OpenGL on other GPU vendors by a lot.

Here are the top 5 highest barrier reductions we have found:

```ini
WRC_4_SCES-52389_20230329024724
Barriers: -6604 [13473=>6869]

Avatar_-_The_Last_Airbender_SLUS-21395_20240428221833
Barriers: -999 [17716=>16717]
```

:::info
The less barriers there is, the better!
:::

#### More, more!

Following the adjustments by TellowKrinkle, LightningTerror has discovered that we can further cut down the barriers on OpenGL in [#13576](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/pull/13576) to only issue barriers for framebuffer optimizations if needed. To check if the state changed previous draw/pass and if not, only then do we need to issue a barrier or render pass to ensure writes.

We basically have an optimization where we replace render passes with barriers in some cases to ensure writes happen, but there were cases where we issued both at the same time, so in this case if we issued a render pass state change then we don't really need barriers.

Here is even more barrier count reductions that we found:

```ini
Ace_Combat_04_-_Shattered_Skies_SLUS-20152_20230214003004

WRC_4_SCES-52389_20230329024724
Barriers: -6603 [13473=>6870]
```

#### MORE!

In [#12969](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/pull/12969), Refraction found a way to improve dirty and readback handling.

Dirty targets were not combining if they overlapped in one direction, which caused there to be extra dirty uploads. Readbacks were happening on 24bit targets when the alpha channel was being requested, this avoids such situations in all renderers.

  ### GS/Texture Cache: Optimize Block Offset Calculations
</PCSX2PRLink>

An optimization was found in several loops where we can swap the `x` and `y` coordinates resulting in higher performance. This is because how CPU caching works where `x` is linear memory and `y` needs to jump around causing a cache miss every time, so by swapping them around it allows us to better use CPU caching.

We also added some extra conditions to avoid going through the loops, as well as some more caching mechanisms for even better performance.

Here is more benchmarks:

  ### GS/HW: Abort Unnecessary Draw Calls
</PCSX2PRLink>

In some specific scenarios we can avoid draw calls if the render target doesn't change and simultaneously depth isn't written either, such conditions were further expanded upon to grant us the ability to cancel useless draw calls (less GPU commands/work, less barriers, less copies, etc) which in some cases gives us some massive improvements.

  ### GS/Direct3D11/12: Destination Alpha Testing Optimizations
</PCSX2PRLink>

Following the addition of software blending on Direct3D11/12, we can optimize some features where if we already use software blending we can use software destination alpha testing as well in shader which is faster instead of splitting it in multiple passes as it will be slower. We don't need to do it in multiple passes as we already have texture copies enabled so we can reuse them for destination alpha testing and bypassing the multiple passes originally needed.

Some optimizations are missing on Direct3D12 like [#13525](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/pull/13525) but will be implemented during the v2.7 dev cycle.

  ### GS/HW: Shuffle improvements
</PCSX2PRLink>

Several fixes have been made to texture shuffle emulation in order to fix some long-standing games.

#### Handles Texture Shuffle With Pixel Reversals ([#13142](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/pull/13142))

Detect when a game (Colin McRae Rally 2005) is doing a texture shuffle and (a) flipping pixel locations horizontally in columns and (b) correcting the pixel locations by flipping pixels horizontally again. Ignore both flips so that they cancel out. To keep it short what this does is fix Colin McRae Rally and is now playable with no hardware rendering issues.

#### Handles Texture Shuffle Sprite Not 16-pixel-multiple Wide ([#13138](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/pull/13138))

Do special handling for texture shuffling sprites that are not 8 pixels wide or a multiple of 16 pixels wide. Align such sprites to 16 pixel boundaries horizontally. This fixes some issues on Alter Echo.

#### Add CRC for Sand Grain Games Palette Shuffle Effect ([#13005](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/pull/13005))

We have no way to do this effect directly without having 50-100 readbacks per frame, which is very very slow, this emulates the effect they're trying to achieve (G->A shuffle with palette).

This fixes some long standing issues with Cabela's games, image comparisons below:

#### Detect offset shuffle on TexIsFB ([#13685](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/pull/13685))

Updates TexIsFB to check for horizontally offset shuffle, this fixes a shuffle issue in Timesplitters 2 where it copied the wrong data.

  ### GS/SW: Do Pre-Clamping of ST Coordinates When They May Overflow
</PCSX2PRLink>

The input texture ST coordinates can sometimes be huge or NaN (for reasons not totally clear, it might be emulation or game bugs) when in rasterizer so they cause issues with calculating the vertex trace values, determining texture bounding boxes, etc. This can cause graphical glitches downstream. This PR attempts to address such issues doing the following:

1. Add checks in the vertex trace for NaN ST values.
2. Add checks in the SW renderer for ST values that would overflow the fixed point format used for texture coordinates in rasterizer.
3. Rewrite vertices and clamp the problematic ST values to a value less that the maximum representable by the rasterizer. Rewrite any NaN values to 0.

  ### The Resizing Saga
</PCSX2PRLink>

It all started with [#13613](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/issues/13613). One of our testers, JordanTheToast had recently upgraded to a Radeon RX 9060 XT. He noticed that resizing PCSX2 while in-game causes massive lag/delay during the resize. This ended up turning into a deep dive that confused the team for days. A look into GPU driver bugs, and the way Qt handles window resize events slowly uncovered the problem.

GovanifY [put up a fight (#13614)](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/pull/13614) by fixing the way Qt handles window resizing in order to make it not fire up multiple resize events per milliseconds (yes, millisecond).

Following [#13614](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/pull/13614) it was noticed that NVIDIA has lost smooth rescaling, unlike AMD which retained it.
This issue was due to a difference in how AMD and NVIDIA reported resized windows. As a result, we would recreate the swapchain at the end of the frame on NVIDIA, but at the beginning of the frame on AMD.
During resizing, the swapchain would become invalidated between the end of one frame and the beginning of the next, causing the rendering on NVIDIA to seemingly freeze.

The fix was to simply defer recreating the swapchain until the beginning of the frame.

#### But Wait, There's More!

It was noticed that RDNA 4 would experience significant delay in resizing even after #13614 was merged.

This was determined to be due to a Vulkan function `vkAcquireNextImageKHR` taking two seconds to complete following a swapchain re-creation. A workaround for this driver bug was to not link the old swapchain to the new one.

While implementing this fix, support for `VK_KHR_swapchain_maintenance1` was added. This may reduce the memory usage from resizing on AMD GPUs with updated drivers. NVIDIA supported the older version we had already been using, so no change is expected there.

  ### Add Qt Buddies and Tabstops
</PCSX2PRLink>

This addition to PCSX2's menus improves accessibility by allowing screen readers to more reliably navigate the interface. It also significantly improves the order of screen elements when navigating with keyboard keys like tab.

#### Buddies

Buddies are properties in Qt which associate a label with an interactive element. This is transparent for most users, but for users with a screen reader this means you can actually tell what an interactive element does. It's a win for accessibility with minimal maintenance overhead and arguably better self-documentation.

For example, focusing a dropdown will just say that you've focused a dropdown without saying what it's supposed to be for – rendering much of our UI totally unusable. With a buddy, it will read out the label on top of the element type. As an example, with buddies the OSD scale option will read approximately as "OSD Scale: Spin Box 100", but without, it will only read "Spin Box 100". There is no way to focus the labels either, so it's unlikely they can be read out without buddies.

#### Tabstops

Have you been in a situation where you have to use a keyboard to navigate your way through PCSX2 and found out that the ordering between options are complete nonsense? Tabstops are here to help!

Tabstops are another property of Qt which allow an explicit ordering of elements when tabbing through a widget (i.e. focusing on one element then pressing Tab). Without them, the tab order is subject to the physical ordering of the elements in XML, which does not inherently correspond to the row/column order displayed and is highly unreliable and unrealistic to maintain.

  ### Improvements to PCSX2 related files handling on macOS
</PCSX2PRLink>

TellowKrinkle, our resident macOS housekeeper, has been working on adding file type associations for some of the file types that can be opened by PCSX2. This includes game dumps (ISO, CSO, ZSO, CHD, etc), save states, GS dumps, PNACH patches, and more.

  ### PCSX2 on macOS Now Uses Qt 6.10
</PCSX2PRLink>

For a long time, macOS has been stuck on Qt 6.7, due to Qt 6.10 dropping support for older macOS versions. It turns out Tellow discovered that it's trivial to patch compatibility for older macOS versions back into Qt 6.10. The rest is history!

  ### Improved Display Surface (And Wayland!)
</PCSX2PRLink>

We have enabled Wayland support by default since PCSX2 2.4.0 release and in this cycle, AirGamer has yet again spearheaded the work to improve Wayland support even further. This time we're cutting out the cruft, resolving technical debt, and implementing it the way it was intended with Qt.

For more technical details, previously the way we rendered into a "surface" was to render it to the widget directly. While this was the canonical method for older versions of Qt, the Qt maintainers mentioned that this was not recommended and a newer method was better suited. This has caused some issues, especially with Wayland.

Instead, this new method now uses a Qt Window instead of a Qt Widget, avoiding issues inherited by the previous method and allowing for the removal of a number of Wayland specific workarounds. Which further improves Wayland compatibility with PCSX2.

#### Simplified Wayland Plugins AppImage Bundling ([#12864](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/pull/12864))

`linuxdeploy` doesn't correctly deploy some Wayland dependencies with the Wayland client modules.

Previously, we manually copied these dependencies into the AppImage. However, it was discovered that specifying the Wayland compositor module will copy the needed client dependencies. This allowed us to simplify our AppImage build script.

  ### Support Full Axis Binds of SDL Gamepad Axes
</PCSX2PRLink>

In SDL, a controller has both a joystick instance and gamepad instance (if SDL has a mapping for it). An SDL joystick is just a collection of buttons and axis and an SDL gamepad has those buttons mapped to a standard gamepad layout. In PCSX2 we accept binds for both the gamepad inputs and any joystick inputs that SDL hasn't mapped. You might recognize these as "Axis X +" or Axis Y -".

Previously, we had separate code for loading joystick axis binds and gamepad axis binds, with only the former supporting full axis binds. This change adds support for "Full Axis" gamepad inputs, which should improve support for special input devices which have axes but do not necessarily have a positive and negative direction, such as the pedal on a wheel.
