  (HW/SW) Z-Buffer improvements and backport from Dobiestation
</PCSX2PRLink>

A huge boost in accuracy that we've accomplished was improving Z-Buffer
emulation on both hardware and software renderers. What this means is
that a lot of games received a boost in accuracy throughout the ps2 game
library. Many text and HUD issues have been resolved. So far these are
the games that we know of that show an improvement:

- Itadaki Street 3 (text display),
- Midnight Club 3 (text input),
- Rozen Maiden DuellWalzer (text)
- F1 2004 (starting lights),
- Alone in the Dark (improper controller display),
- Silent Hill 2 and 3 (textures not showing on different angles such
  as toilet),
- Syphon Filter: The Omega Strain (weapon HUD),
- Tomb Raider Angel of Darkness (book pictures).

For anyone interested what Z-Buffering is and it's technical aspects,
there is a nice wiki page that you can read
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-buffering) .

Here are some eye candy image comparisons from some of the mentioned
games

Itadaki Street:

<SliderCompare

  after={require("./img/Itadaki-Street-after.webp").default}

<PCSX2PRLink authors="lightningterror,tadanokojin" prNums="3436">
  (HW) Improved Texture shuffle detection
</PCSX2PRLink>

To put it simply it improves the effect detection so that games can be
properly rendered, plus we removed the CRC hacks that were in its place
to skip the bad draw calls. So far we know of only two games that hit
the code path such as Onimusha 3 and Devil May Cry 3, but we believe
there are more that we don't know of.

Everybody loves image comparisons right?

Onimusha 3:

<SliderCompare
  before={require("./img/Onimusha-3-before.webp").default}
  after={require("./img/Onimusha-3-after.webp").default}
/>

Devil May Cry 3:

<SliderCompare
  before={require("./img/DMC3-before.webp").default}
  after={require("./img/DMC3-after.webp").default}
/>

<PCSX2PRLink authors="iMineLink" prNums="3131">
  (HW) Invalidate Source with overlapping draw
</PCSX2PRLink>

Improve texture cache Source objects invalidation logic taking into
account overlapping with current draw.
Fixes eyes rendering for the Major in Jak 1.

<SliderCompare
  before={require("./img/Jak-before.webp").default}
  after={require("./img/Jak-after.webp").default}
/>

<PCSX2PRLink authors="iMineLink" prNums="3075">
  (HW) Extend Software Sprite Renderer to Dragonball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 2 and 3
</PCSX2PRLink>

Previously we've discussed that we have a new feature called
SWSpriteRenderer that we use to properly render the Jak character model
in Jak games. Now we are extending the feature as well as improving the
SWSpriteRenderer code itself to work on Budokai Tenkaichi 2 and 3 games.
This improves rendering of Kaio-ken effect in Dragonball Z Budokai
Tenkaichi 2, as well as improve character silhouette in Dragonball Z
Budokai Tenkaichi 2 and 3 when a character is hidden from displaying
from an obstacle (rock for example), as well as properly render
character flashing on a charged attack.

So far only Jak and Budokai Tenkaichi 2 and 3 games use this feature. In
the future we plan on finding more games that can benefit from this,
further improve the feature and always enable it by default along with
auto detection.

Budokai Tenkaichi 2:

<SliderCompare
  before={require("./img/DBZBT2-before.webp").default}
  after={require("./img/DBZBT2-after.webp").default}

Budokai Tenkaichi 3:

<SliderCompare

  after={require("./img/DBZBT3-after.webp").default}

<PCSX2PRLink authors="KrossX" prNums="3027">
  (HW) Add dithering support
</PCSX2PRLink>

Dithering support has been added on all hardware renderers. Another
great step in increasing accuracy which further matches or gets close to
Software renderer. For more specifics about what dithering is you can
check this link [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither) . For those
who wish to turn off dithering on the latest development builds they can
do so with the Page Down key which is temporary or edit the GSdx ini
file which is permanent. There are 3 levels. Off, Scaled and Unscaled. A
lot of games use dithering so here is an example below from Castlevania.

<SliderCompare
  before={require("./img/castlevania-before.webp").default}
  after={require("./img/castlevania-after.webp").default}
/>

<PCSX2PRLink authors="lightningterror" prNums="3264">
  (HW) Color clip blending improvements
</PCSX2PRLink>

- Enable non recursive blending when blending is set to None.Previously non recursive blending was enabled only when blending wasset to Basic or higher, and now it will be active on None option aswell as there are 0 drawbacks. It is faster so games will gain acouple of FPS when blending is disabled and it is also moreaccurate. A win - win situation.

- (OpenGL) Always use accurate sw blending on Safe/Accurate Framebuffer masking instead of accumulation mode. Fixes shadows inSuperman Shadows of Apokolips, see image comparison below.

<SliderCompare
  before={require("./img/Superman-Shadows-of-Apokolips-before.webp").default}
  after={require("./img/Superman-Shadows-of-Apokolips-after.webp").default}
/>

## Other important GSdx changes

<PCSX2PRLink authors="lightningterror" prNums="3274">
  (PSX/PS1 emu) PS1 emulator plugin support has been dropped/removed
</PCSX2PRLink>

(PSX/PS1 emu) PS1 emulator plugin support has been dropped/removed, as the code wasn't maintained at all and the feature was barely working. What does this mean? GSdx as a plugin can no longer be used on other ps1 emulators that support a plugin interface such as ePSXe. PS1 titles can still be played using PCSX2.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="lightningterror" prNums="3304">
  (HW) Custom Resolution has been removed from the GUI
</PCSX2PRLink>

(HW) CustomResolution has been removed from the GUI. The option didn't work properly with many features such as Depth Emulation, Destination Alpha Test and many more, breaking accurate emulation in the process. For anyone still wishing to use Custom Resolution even though we strongly advise against it, they can modify the GSdx ini file.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="tadanokojin,PSI-Rockin" prNums="3263">
  (HW/SW) Mirror RGBAQ to 0x11
</PCSX2PRLink>

(HW/SW) Mirror RGBAQ to 0x11. FixesRidge Racer V shadows, see image comparison below. Backported from Dobiestation.

<SliderCompare
  before={require("./img/Ridge-Racer-V-before.webp").default}
  after={require("./img/Ridge-Racer-V-after.webp").default}
/>

<PCSX2PRLink authors="refractionpcsx2" prNums="3279">
  (HW/SW) Mask A+D addresses
</PCSX2PRLink>

(HW/SW) Mask A+D addresses. Fixes network configuration wizard display issues on some games, see image comparison below. Backported from Dobiestation.

<SliderCompare
  before={require("./img/network-config-before.webp").default}
  after={require("./img/network-config-after.webp").default}
/>

<PCSX2PRLink authors="lightningterror" prNums="3440">
  (HW) Alpha Stencil hack has been now completely removed from the Direct3D10/11
  renderer as well
</PCSX2PRLink>

(HW) Alpha Stencil hack has been now completely removed from the Direct3D10/11 renderer as well. As it was the case with OpenGL now DATE Accuracy renders the effects properly with little to no side effects, leaving Alpha Stencil completely useless. In 9 out of 10 cases Alpha Stencil used to break plenty of post processing effects which was an awful hack.

# Core Improvements

<PCSX2PRLink authors="turtleli" prNums="3311,3400">
  IPU Improvements
</PCSX2PRLink>

- Adds dithering to the RGB32-&gt;RGB16 conversion (see images from Hisshou Pachinko PachiSlot Kouryaku Series Vol 10 - carefully).

<SliderCompare
  before={
    require("./img/Hisshou-Pachinko-PachiSlot-Kouryaku-Series-Vol-10-before.webp")
      .default
  }
  after={
    require("./img/Hisshou-Pachinko-PachiSlot-Kouryaku-Series-Vol-10-after.webp")
      .default
  }
/>

- Adds SSE2 implementation of RGB32-&gt;RGB16 conversion (speed on the opening FMV in Hisshou Pachinko PachiSlot Kouryaku Series Vol 10 goes from \~175% to \~275% with frame limiter disabled using GSdx software mode).

- Implements VQ (see images from Klonoa 2).

<SliderCompare
  before={require("./img/klonoa-2-before.webp").default}
  after={require("./img/klonoa-2-after.webp").default}
/>

- Removes GameDB patches for Klonoa 2, and revert workaround for Klonoa 2 crashes which are no longer needed.

# Misc Improvements

<PCSX2PRLink authors="tellowkrinkle" prNums="3357">
  Preliminary work on macOS support
</PCSX2PRLink>

It still needs a lot work but it's a great step moving forward

<PCSX2PRLink authors="lightningterror,Ryudo300" prNums="3477,3423">
  Better DPI scaling support
</PCSX2PRLink>

Fixed some texts being cut off from the GUI on several plugins as well as the glitchy logo when using DPI scaling.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="arcum42" prNums="3420">
  Switch over the null plugins dialog code to use wxWidgets instead of gtk on
  Linux
</PCSX2PRLink>

- Windows 7 and Windows 8 support has been dropped in order to move forward.

- There have been other improvements made such as more code cleanups, bug fixes and other improvements but we won't mention them since they aren't that big of a deal.

# Future Plans

64 bit support is in progress and getting along nicely, more work on
macOS support, more juicy new core accuracy improvements that will be
mentioned in the next report, more code cleanups, refactoring,
overhauling and so on.
