title: PCSX2 Mac Updates

The developer of the Mac port of PCSX2,
[zedr0n](http://forums.pcsx2.net/User-zedr0n) , came back with a bang
after some time of silence! He has released a new version of his 0.9.6
port of PCSX2 for Lion with some additional compatibility fixes. Here is
what he had to say about it:

<!-- truncate -->

> I'm releasing a slightly updated version of pcsx2 0.9.6 it
> should crash less because of the audio plugin. 0.9.7 is proving very
> difficult so no update for now.
>
> From this version onwards this becomes a regular .dmg bundle with
> pcsx2.app separated from the required libraries package which is still
> included in the dmg by default.
> You can get it from Downloads or direct link pcsx2.dmg
>
> The package has been cleaned so that all libraries reside in
> /usr/local/pcsx2 and can be removed easily. The Uninstaller.pkg
> included in the dmg will do that for you.
>
> Latest version of XQuartz and CG framework still required

In addition, he released an early 0.9.7 alpha port. This version should
be considered unstable and pre-beta but you can give it a try. Here is
what was posted about this:
