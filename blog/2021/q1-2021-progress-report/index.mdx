## Core Improvements

<PCSX2PRLink authors="refractionpcsx2" prNums="4115">
  PAD/Counters: MakeVSync Queue adjustable in the UI. Extra Pad update.
</PCSX2PRLink>

New UI option (ini option has been there a while) so users can choose between a little bit extra performance or reduced input lag.

Also added the PAD Update to the VSync call in Counters as it seemed to reduce input lag marginally.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="refractionpcsx2" prNums="4066">
  IPU: Return contentsof the bottom of the FIFO in CMD except FDEC/VDEC.
</PCSX2PRLink>

This is based on the work by [@PS1-Rockin](https://github.com/PSI-Rockin) on Dobiestation but modified based on the theory that it always returns the first 32bits of the FIFO unless an FDEC/VDEC command is executed, however FDEC is basically doing this anyway, but VDEC returns decoded information.

Fixed videos for probably all broken EA games, but namely:

- F1 2001
- F1 2002
- Neo Contra
- Shox
- Theme Park Rollercoaster/World

<PCSX2PRLink authors="refractionpcsx2" prNums="4225">
  IPU: Fill Input FIFOon command end ready for next command.
</PCSX2PRLink>

Dance Summit 2001: So basically what the game does is it does some IPU
stuff, but the DMA is left with 1 QWC left to be read on the DMA, on the
hardware this will normally be flushed in to the FIFO. The game then
does a FIFO reset (To get rid of it) then starts another DMA. The
problem we have is because we still had the DMA pending for 1 QWC, it
ignored the new DMA start and the IPU would hang up waiting for data to
be fed in. This PR resolves that problem.

Test Drive: Also added DMA 4 (To IPU) being flushed if BCLR is called
without first stopping the DMA.

Set the Picture type on VDEC to I-Picture if set to 0 in the IPU_CTRL,
this fixes a bunch of Eyetoy games which incorrectly set this register.

- Fixes EyeToy Play(1-3).
- Fixes Bakufuu Slash!! Kizna Arashi.
- Fixes Kaiketsu Zorro Mezase! SIF0 and SIF1 stall control.
- Fixes Test Drive: IPU hang in middle of Event 5.

### SPU2

<PCSX2PRLink authors="refractionpcsx2" prNums="4074">
  SPU2: Attempt 96khz sample rate if 48khz fails (WASAPI).
</PCSX2PRLink>

WASAPI is terrible and doesn't support sample rate conversion in shared
(normal) mode and requires exclusive mode.

This PR basically attempts to double the PS2 sample rate of 48khz to
96khz as this tends to be the other windows default. If this fails it
will put a log message to say you need to use Exclusive mode.

Note: When using PS1 game emulation you will need to use exclusive mode,
nothing I can do about this (44.1khz doesn't divide nicely from 48khz or
96khz).

  SPU2: Update voices before DMA reads, reset OutPos on reset
</PCSX2PRLink>

Improves the booting reliability of GTA VC, especially on consecutive boots without closing the emulator.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="Ziemas" prNums="4134">
  Switch to a more accurate noise algorithm
</PCSX2PRLink>

This algorithm comes from PCSX-R and is an implementation of Dr. Hell's research.

The previous implementation was a simple LFSR and did not use the
provided noise clock from the ATTR register.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="refractionpcsx2" prNums="4171">
  SPU2: Improve ADMA behaviour/timing.
</PCSX2PRLink>

- Hopefully improves the crackling in burnout 3.
- Fixes music looping in Ratatouille.
- Fixes Vexx clicking sound (Partial ADMA transfers).
- Fixes the Dolby Pro Logic video missing sound in Primal (Partial ADMA transfers).
- Fixes Splinter Cell panning audio problem and high pitched noises in cut-scenes.
- Fixes Myst 3 panning audio problem.
- Fixes Dynasty Warriors 5 stuttering videos when Dolby is enabled.

  SPU2: Tighten AutoDMA IRQ timing
</PCSX2PRLink>

Fixes games which monitor the MADR while transferring.

Fixes Tom & Jerry in War of the Whiskers jumpy music.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="Ziemas" prNums="4210">
  Adjust interpolation implementations
</PCSX2PRLink>

These seems to be have been adjusted to match the output of catmull-rom
which is really the one in the wrong by being twice as loud.

As a result of the interpolated output being at a reasonable level we
can use ApplyVolume to apply the ADSR volume.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="refractionpcsx2" prNums="4203">
  SPU2: Make sure cache hits match previous block decoded samples.
</PCSX2PRLink>

Caching blocks of ADPCM is a bit sketchy because the previous samples
(which it uses to generate the new ones) can change depending on if it's
the start of the voice on or if it has looped around, so you can end up
with blips and glitches in the sample stream, this should avoid that
problem whilst not making the cache completely unusable.

Should get rid of clicking and popping noises in loops samples.

Fixes Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy sound distortion.

Also fixes remaining blips in Vexx.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="Ziemas" prNums="4195">
  Add Gaussian interpolation
</PCSX2PRLink>

This implements the actual SPU interpolation as documented by nocash.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="Ziemas" prNums="4226">
  Resample reverb input/output
</PCSX2PRLink>

The reverb runs at half the sample rate of the rest of the SPU so a
change of sample rate is required. The way this is currently done is by
decimating when down-sampling and duplicating samples when up-sampling
without doing any filtering.

This adds proper filtering to this process, the filter coefficients are
from Mednafen but we think they were originally found by Neill Corlett.

  SPU2: Try to recover DMA pointer after savestate load
</PCSX2PRLink>

<PCSX2PRLink authors="refractionpcsx2" prNums="4186">
  SPU2: Ignore LSAL/H Writes after key on if voice sets loop point.
</PCSX2PRLink>

Fixes behaviour with loop address writes within 4T's of a voice keying
on which is what the old Delay Cycles tried to address, if the voice
sets its own loop point the write from hardware is ignored.

Fixes Mafia music loops.

  Reset IRQ Status when swapping game in case it got set previously
</PCSX2PRLink>

### Memory Card

<PCSX2PRLink authors="Ziemas" prNums="4113">
  Memorycards: Fix out of bounds array access in folder memcards.
</PCSX2PRLink>

Don't keep the DataClusterInUse bit when accessing the next cluster.

With this folder memcards work on 64bit.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="KrossX" prNums="2995">
  Memorycards: Add support for OpenPS2Loader VirtualMemoryCards.
</PCSX2PRLink>

Adds some basic support to OPL VMC files (.bin) that use 512 bytes
pages.

Normal pages are 528 bytes long, those extra 16 bytes contain 12 bytes
of ECC data.

### Debuggers

<PCSX2PRLink authors="F0bes" prNums="4252">
  Debugger: Add \
</PCSX2PRLink>

<PCSX2PRLink authors="F0bes" prNums="4289">
  Debugger: Require emulator start before enabling Break/Run button.
</PCSX2PRLink>

<PCSX2PRLink authors="F0bes" prNums="4326,4287">
  Misc: Support more BIOSes for the Debugger Thread View.
</PCSX2PRLink>

<PCSX2PRLink authors="GovanifY" prNums="4271">
  GS/Core: Implement the new generation of GS Debugger.
</PCSX2PRLink>

This is a full in-core reimplementation of GSDumpGUI. It will be used
for GS Debugging once GSdx is merged in to the core.

One step closer in to merging GSdx in to the core.

### Misc core

<PCSX2PRLink authors="monster860" prNums="3011">

</PCSX2PRLink>

<PCSX2PRLink authors="F0bes" prNums="4234">

<PCSX2PRLink authors="Nobbs66" prNums="4223">
  PGIF: PS1DRV handlesbit 28 of GPU Status register, not PGIF.
</PCSX2PRLink>

Fixes several PSX games:

- Castlevania: Symphony of the Night
- Twisted Metal
- Pink Panther

<PCSX2PRLink authors="jackun" shas="c695a7eabbac4c3a0138b6eeb0e9005ff708f985">
  USB: usb-mic: Send 1ms worth of samples for 48kHz and 8kHz sample rates
</PCSX2PRLink>

<PCSX2PRLink authors="CookiePLMonster" prNums="4310">
  USB: Improve Force Feedback test so it doesn't block UI.
</PCSX2PRLink>

This modifies DirectInput USB Force Feedback test not to block the UI.
Instead of performing the test synchronously on the UI thread, a timer
gets created which advances the test every half a second.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="Florin9doi" prNums="4232">
  Eyetoy mirroring
</PCSX2PRLink>

- Fixes Bakufuu Slash! Kizna Arashi.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="F0bes" prNums="4250">
  Core: Preserve read only bits in the COP0 config register.
</PCSX2PRLink>

The read-only bits in question are the Instruction cache size (IC) and
the Data cache size (DC).

Before this MTC0 would freely write to the entire config register.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="F0bes" prNums="4123">
  Core: Implement proper %s handling for syscall 117 (0x75).
</PCSX2PRLink>

This makes the syscall iterate through the format string which can be
considered "slow" but this syscall is only going to be used for
debugging purposes.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="Tupelov" prNums="4255">
  Core: Added support for little endian data for patches.
</PCSX2PRLink>

Allows users to use the leshort, leword, and ledouble datatypes inside
their patches. Using these datatypes ensures that values in the memory
view appear the same as the values in the patch.

This was made with easing patch development in mind as now developers
can make patches without having to reverse endianness. This is
especially useful when using programs like ghidra that displays
instructions in little endian.

## GSdx Improvements

<PCSX2PRLink authors="lightningterror,tadanokojin" prNums="4206">
  GSdx-hw: Implement per pixel alpha blending (PABE).
</PCSX2PRLink>

Improves shadow/lighting effects on certain games, both HW renderers
support the feature.

So far we have a few games that see an improvement:

Fixes Strawberry Shortcake character shadow/lighting.

Fixes Cartoon Network Racing shadow/lighting.

And for those that enjoy some image comparisons:

Cartoon Network Racing: Before -&gt; After

<SliderCompare
  before={require("./img/cnr_before_s.webp").default}
  after={require("./img/cnr_after_s.webp").default}
/>

Strawberry Shortcake: Before -&gt; After

<SliderCompare
  before={require("./img/ss_before_s.webp").default}
  after={require("./img/ss_after_s.webp").default}
/>

### Misc GSdx

## IPC (Interprocess Communication) Improvements

<PCSX2PRLink authors="GovanifY" prNums="4262">
  Socket re-usability
</PCSX2PRLink>

This avoids port overfills on windows, while increasing performance
substantially on platforms that do port overfills.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="GovanifY" prNums="4267">
  Add a slot system
</PCSX2PRLink>

This allows multiple emulator sessions to run at the same time and
windows user to configure their used port to their preferred one.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="GovanifY" prNums="4272">
  Fix type polymorphism & checkbox
</PCSX2PRLink>

Some versions of wxWidgets are more sensitive than others on dynamic
casting, so instead I used a C style cast to prevent any crash.

## GameDB Improvements

<PCSX2PRLink authors="RedPanda4552" prNums="4259">
  GameDB: Add improved Xenosaga save crash prevention patch.
</PCSX2PRLink>

Updated patch rewrites a chunk of game code to decrement JPEG quality,
rather than just immediately floor it. Allows thumbnails to still look
kind of okay.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="kozarovv" prNums="4187,4249">
  Add patchesfor KOF series
</PCSX2PRLink>

Fixes depth precision, game fills upper 16bits of depth with 0xFFFF.
This results in a really high 32 bit value which is then converted to
float because both HW and SW renderers lack double precision the lower
16 bits of the initial 32 bit value lose precision.

## Misc Improvements

<PCSX2PRLink authors="kenshen112" prNums="3999">

</PCSX2PRLink>

MacOS was using linux paths rather than wx's macOS-specific subclass,
which doesn't match how the app is installed in macOS (all paths should
be relative to the executable).

Also adds steps to copy missing resources into the app bundle.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="rtissera" prNums="4243">

  Capture: Optimizations with file names, SPU2 recording, and capture menu gui
</PCSX2PRLink>

Addresses some oversights involving transferring a file name between the
GS & SPU2 recording setups.

Adds a new audio toggle setting that allows a user to control whether a
WAV file should be generated alongside a video recording. In doing this,
behavior for when SPU2 recording fails to be setup becomes more defined
and consistent.

Additionally, F12 will now route to sMainFrame if GUI is active as to
keep the capture menu GUI accurate to the current state.
