## Core Improvements

### DEV9

<PCSX2PRLink authors="TheLastRar" prNums="4381">
  DEV9: Do not apply byteswapping to TX/RX FIFO writes/reads
</PCSX2PRLink>

- Remove the byte swapping done to TX/RX FIFO writes/reads performed via registers.
- Fixes Twisted Metal: Black Online Public Beta v. 1.0 unable to initialize network adapter.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="macmenot" prNums="4364">
  Add ATA Idle Immediate (E1) stub
</PCSX2PRLink>

- Fixes HDD support for Street Fighter Alpha Anthology.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="macmenot" prNums="4403">
  Consistently prefix all console output with DEV9
</PCSX2PRLink>

<PCSX2PRLink authors="TheLastRar" prNums="4429">
  Update ATA code for wchar GHC
</PCSX2PRLink>

<PCSX2PRLink authors="TheLastRar" prNums="4496">
  PCAP, check size of read packet
</PCSX2PRLink>

- In PCAP, check size of read packet. If the size exceeds the buffer we are using, drop the packet.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="TheLastRar" prNums="4448">
  Always use binary mode for HDD file
</PCSX2PRLink>

- Opening the file in binary mode is the intended behaviour (and was done in the most common situation),

<PCSX2PRLink authors="TheLastRar" prNums="4449">
  Fix potential out of bounds access when manual DNS1 & automatic DNS2 are used
  together
</PCSX2PRLink>

- If DNS1 was manually specified, but DNS2 set to be automatically assigned, an off by one error could result in an out of bounds access to an array of adapter DNS addresses.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="TheLastRar" prNums="4442">
  Increase min HDD size to 40GiB
</PCSX2PRLink>

- Most games expect a HDD of 40GiB in size, and may fail to install as a result (and display a confusing error message).

<PCSX2PRLink authors="TheLastRar" prNums="4304">
  Internal DHCP support
</PCSX2PRLink>

- Adds an internal DHCP similar to what CLR\DEV9 offers for PCAP & TAP.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="TheLastRar" prNums="4433">
  Correctly populate DNS2 field with DNS2 IP
</PCSX2PRLink>

- Correctly populate DNS2 field with DNS2 IP in the DHCP section of the network ui.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="TheLastRar" prNums="4435">
  Sleep instead of yield in RxThread
</PCSX2PRLink>

- Yield might not leave the thread asleep long enough to prevent it from causing excessive CPU load.
- This also brings PCSX2 inline with CLR_DEV9 (which also sleeps for 1ms).

### Memory Cards

<PCSX2PRLink authors="CookiePLMonster" prNums="3941">
  Folder memcards: Add an index file to track order of files
</PCSX2PRLink>

> Adds an index file for folder memory cards in order to track timestamps
> and order of files in the FAT partition properly. This normally
> shouldn't matter, but there are at least a few games (ie. GTA games)
> which rely on the order of files on the memory card. Previously, folder
> memcards would not care about the order and populate the partition in
> whatever order the host filesystem provided the files (so, in the case
> of NTFS partitions, alphabetically). In reality, FAT partitions don't
> specify the order of files, which means in practice they are sorted to
> the order of creation.

- Fixes saving in GTA games with folder memory cards.

### microVU

  Fix mistake when setting Status Flag bits for Signed/Zero
</PCSX2PRLink>

<PCSX2PRLink authors="RedDevilus" prNums="3825">
  Change default of latency slider
</PCSX2PRLink>

>
  Remove MTVU spam that isn't required
</PCSX2PRLink>

Solves stuttering in MTVU mode in some games, and gets rid of some
annoying asserts which mean nothing.

### SPU2

<PCSX2PRLink authors="RedDevilus" prNums="3825">
  Change default of latency slider
</PCSX2PRLink>

<PCSX2PRLink

>
  Fix hi def audio streaming
</PCSX2PRLink>

<PCSX2PRLink authors="Ziemas" prNums="4474">
  Remove cycleptr, grab current cycles directly
</PCSX2PRLink>

- This just changes the SPU2 to get the current IOP cycle directly instead
  of through a pointer. The non-pointer path seems to have been given up
  on anyway and there seems to be little reason for hiding it behind a
  pointer.
- This removes the path where SPU2 runs off the provided cycle argument to
  SPU2Async, but that was unused anyway.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="Ziemas" prNums="4437">
  Make SPU use theDMA registers from iopHw.
</PCSX2PRLink>

The SPU was managing its own DMA Addresses, this makes it use the iopHw
functionality for this instead.

### PAD

<PCSX2PRLink authors="KrossX" prNums="4331">
  Just enablepressure on CMD 0x4F
</PCSX2PRLink>

Fixes Warriors of Might and Magic GamePad not functioning properly.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="Lahvuun" prNums="4466">
  Fix gamepad choice not affecting rumble test on Linux
</PCSX2PRLink>

This change causes the currently selected GamePad to rumble instead of
the first one.

### Eyetoy

<PCSX2PRLink authors="Florin9doi" prNums="4415">
  Motion buttonsupport.
</PCSX2PRLink>

### Debuggers

<PCSX2PRLink authors="F0bes" prNums="4345">
  Bios threadview support.
</PCSX2PRLink>

### Misc core

<PCSX2PRLink authors="F0bes" prNums="4399">
  Core / VU: Disable MTVU when VU1 Interpreter is selected.
</PCSX2PRLink>

<PCSX2PRLink authors="kozarovv" prNums="3860">
  Remove FPUCompare Hack
</PCSX2PRLink>

The hack is no longer needed as full Clamping mode can be used instead.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="F0bes" prNums="4461">
  DifferentiateImpossible block clearing message from IOP & EE
</PCSX2PRLink>

Prefix the "Impossible block clearing failure" with "\[IOP\]" or
"\[EE\]" depending on the recompiler.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="Nobbs66" prNums="4425">
  Fix Emulated PSXGPU Version.
</PCSX2PRLink>

Previously it was thought that the PS2 would emulate the v2 GPU, but
hardware tests show that it emulates the V0 GPU.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="refractionpcsx2,tadanokojin,PSI-Rockin" prNums="4460">
  Make DMA's instant during the BIOS
</PCSX2PRLink>

> This hackfixes the BIOS to avoid a Data Cache bug caused a DMA buffer
> being overwritten during a transfer without waiting, which messes up the
> fonts in the BIOS. Fixing this correctly would require implementing the
> Data Cache, which is something which would make the emulator basically
> unusable, so this is a reasonable solution, it is only enabled during
> the BIOS screen.

- Fixes certain bios revisions rendering text incorrectly.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="TellowKrinkle" prNums="4498">
  MoverecConstBuf memory near recompiler memory
</PCSX2PRLink>

- Fixes an issue where recConstBuf was too far away from the main recompiler to LEA in 64-bit builds.

<PCSX2PRLink authors="turtleli" prNums="4482">
  Fix disc drivepath issues on Windows.
</PCSX2PRLink>

- Fixes [#3910](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/issues/3910) - CDVD Regression: Booting a physical disc inserted after opening PCSX2 doesn't work. (Regression only affects Windows).
- Fixes an issue where the drive choice is cleared if there is no disc in the selected drive when PCSX2 is first opened (Should only affect Windows, but non-Windows only code is touched too).

## GSdx Improvements

### Misc GSdx

<PCSX2PRLink authors="lightningterror" prNums="4350">
  Removepartial and full crc hack levels on release builds
</PCSX2PRLink>
