title: PCSX2 Playground V1.0.0395 And New Forums!
---

After a really long period of silence, we're back with a bang!

<!-- truncate -->

Today we are announcing the release of **PCSX2 Playground 1.0.0395**

Born as a 'playground' test-bed for PCSX2 modifications and code, the
Playground project evolved into much more, over a period of about 4
months.
Created by Air (aka Jake Stine), arcum42, cottonvibes, drkIIRaziel, rama
and tested by Krakatos, the team would like to thank:

- Thanks to the original PCSX2 development team, to the betatesters and
  to everyone that helped them. Without their work, PCSX2 would not exist,
  and neither would the Playground project!
- Thanks to the PCSX2 team once more for graciously hosting our forums.
- Thanks to the PCSX2 team once again for providing hosting space
  ðŸ˜Š
- Thanks to Gigaherz for the render used in the playground logo
- Thanks to all the people who tried the various Playground revisions
  over these months, providing us with helpful feedback
- Thanks to everyone else who supported Playground, without you all this
  would have not been possible!

The PCSX2 team decided to support this project by having the official
beta testers also test it and hosting their binary and forum, since
they've been doing some great job
ðŸ˜Š
You can grab the new binary which includes a plugin pack (and a heavily
modified SPU2Ghz for your sound pleasure!) in our download section here

Also,today we open our **new official forums** , hosted right here at

ðŸ˜Š We would like to thank Bobbi and the NGemu
network for hosting our forums for so long!
Our new forum is totally dedicated to PCSX2 and has sections for the
official release,the public beta, plugins and the playground build
