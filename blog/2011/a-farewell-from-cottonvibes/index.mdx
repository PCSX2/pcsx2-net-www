title: A Farewell From Cottonvibes
---

As of today I am officially retiring from the PCSX2 emulation project.
I am being offered a great job opportunity which will not only utilize
my programming skills, but will provide an environment which allows them
to further grow and improve.

<!-- truncate -->

The decision to leave was not an easy one, and I would not leave the
project for just any job, but this career opportunity is too good to let
it slide.

I have learned a great deal in my years coding for PCSX2, and I want to
thank the team for allowing me to work with them on this great project.
I hope the project continues to improve in my absence, and I look
forward to the future PCSX2 v1.0 release.

So to the PCSX2 team, thanks and good luck!
And thank you to the users who appreciated my work.
