title: Air - The Latest PCSX2 Retiree
---

Jake Stine (Air) has retired from PCSX2, after more than two years of vigorous work on the emulator.

<!-- truncate -->

My reason for leaving is simple: I am now married and am taking a job
that promises to be interesting and challenging, and will be paying me
quite well -- and I fully intend to apply myself there as I have here:
with unwavering dedication and focus.

I have really enjoyed working with PCSX2 these past 2+ years. I have
learned a lot about a wide variety of things including (and not limited
to) becoming intimately familiar with console hardware design, and
developing more advanced high and low level software development skills
-- such as binary translation and better understanding of operating
systems and application binary interfaces (ABIs).

I will be leaving a few unfinished projects in my wake, such as the
R3000A rewrite (recompiler and interpreter), and new dmac work. These
side-projects were educational in their own ways for myself and other
PCSX2 contributors, however; even if they never quite survived into
"profoundly operational" status.

I wish good luck to users and current and future PCSX2 developers and
bid everyone a proper farewell -- perhaps unusual in emulation, a scene
where the programmers often silently vanish.
