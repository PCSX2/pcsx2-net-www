It's already close to 2012 but here I am once more wishing on Christmas day to everyone following and using PCSX2!

<!-- truncate -->

So we all wish you will get what you want (and wish even more it's a new PC so you can run PCSX2 better!!), have fun and enjoy these few days with your loved ones because that's what counts in the end. If you don't celebrate Christmas, Merry Sunday!

In other news, 0.9.9 is still in development with Gabest making a surprise comeback lately and working on the software rendering of GSdx. You can give the latest changes a try by going [HERE](/downloads)

And finally, an image I ripp..err found on the internet which is
appropriate for the day and place! ðŸ˜›
