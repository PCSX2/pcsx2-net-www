Having broken the **100,000** !! unique visitor count, and nearing the
**500,000** page clicks mark we decided to thank all the people who have
visited this site, and support the project with a few videos from the
current _WIP_ 0.9 version.

<!-- truncate -->

<!-- TODO - legacy find videos -->

Four videos for you to enjoy:

Final Fantasy X - Ingame At Kilika
2 Minutes 44 Seconds | 28.7MB | Real Ingame Speed - 10-32 FPS.

Guilty Gear Isuka - Ingame Fighting Action
2 Minutes 12 Seconds | 23.4MB | Real Ingame Speed - 20-25 FPS.

Rakugaki Onkoku 3D Intro
2 Minutes 28 Seconds | 19.4MB | Real Ingame Speed - 10-15 FPS.

Virtua Fighter 4 - Evolution - Some fun ingame action!
2 Minutes 35 Seconds | 27.6MB | Real Ingame Speed - 10-15 FPS.

All the videos where recorded through **GSdx**
and are automatically sped up, so you are _NOT_ watching actual emulated
speeds! The real FPS is shown under each video link! Given that these
videos are being shared through Bit Torrent, we ask if you could seed
(share) these files for as long as possible!

Thank you for visiting, and enjoy the videos!
