**Linuzappz** the lead coder for the _PCSX2_ project has 'officially'
quit. This is due to several reasons, from slowly losing interest in the
project, to simply not having enough time to work on it.

<!-- truncate -->

I won't pull punches here, this _is_ a major blow to this project as he
is responsible for so much code, plugins and has an extensive knowledge
of the **PlayStation 2** . Whilst he will pop in 'rarely' to lend a
hand, or some advice he won't be working on it further

All of the betatesting team, his fellow developers and the general
people who lend help in **#PCSX2** will greatly miss him. We send him
all our best, wish him luck with his hectic life and lets hope he gets
at least one date with **Carolina Ardoh√°in (Pampita)**

**PCSX2** is far from dead and both **shadow** , **Saqib** will maintain
the project with the heap of coders we do have (Refraction, auMatt,
GoldFinger etc..)

Given this project has come so far just recently
we won't be letting it go the way of the dodo.
