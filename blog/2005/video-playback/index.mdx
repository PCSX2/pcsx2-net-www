title: Video Playback!
---

**Saqib** fixed a large portion of **IPU** (Image Processing Unit)
support in PCSX2, whilst this work is highly WIP and only just happened,
it is giving impressive results.

<!-- truncate -->

Videos (FMV's, cutscenes etc) had previously required patches to skip
past them, otherwise the emulator would hang, now many games are playing
videos (all be it very broken looking in many cases!), examples of games
now showing FMV playback would include: Onimusha 2, Onimusha 3, R:
Racing, Project Zero, Soul Calibur II, Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy
X-2 etc.

Video support will greatly increase the compatibility of PCSX2 and open
up even more games for testing and viewing pleasure.

To show you this good news our tester **Rudy_X** produced a video from
**Final Fantasy X DEMO** to show you video playback and how it allows
you to progress further into the game!
