Merry Christmas to everyone, from the PCSX2 team!

<!-- truncate -->

Hope everyone has a fantastic time, and a great New Years! Make sure you
get plenty of presents, and party hard

No release for Christmas, but one coming sometime in **January** - we
hope, assuming shadow, saqib and refraction don't get lost, drunk or
kidnapped by kinky Japanese Female Ninjas (they wish that would happen)
