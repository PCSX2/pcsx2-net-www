Time to brighten up the front page of this site with some sexy news.
ðŸ˜Š

<!-- truncate -->

**Parotaku** one of our long serving betatesters has been having 'fun'
testing _Biohazard 4 (Resident Evil 4)_ under the WIP PCSX2 0.9 beta.
Whilst there are still many issues with this game, such as a lack of
memory card detection, it is fully playable, and looking utterly
gorgeous at high res.

<!-- TODO legacy video find it -->

!! The video was recorded through **GSdx** which automatically speeds up
video, so you are _NOT_ watching actual emulated speeds! The real FPS is
shown under the video link! Given that this video is being shared
through Bit Torrent, we ask if you could seed (share) this file for as
long as possible!

Enjoy the video!
