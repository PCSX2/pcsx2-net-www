...Yes you read that correctly, and no it's not April 1st!

<!-- truncate -->

**WAIT** !!..Okay so you knew there would be a catch
😛

**MTGS** (Multi Threaded GS) has recently become much more stable thanks
to *zerofrog* and his recent improvements to **ZeroGS** (a GS plugin for
PCSX2). MTGS allows for people with **Dual Core** CPU's to run PCSX2 at
significantly improved speeds by putting the graphics side of PCSX2 onto
a separate core.

ZeroGS itself has also gone through a **major** overhaul, making it
significantly faster, even without the use of MTGS, so the Single Core
crowd will also see a speed boost via this plugin!

ZeroGS offers more features in the up coming release, with improved AA,
wireframe mode, video recording, bilinear filtering and pre-defined
resolutions to choose from.

So whats the catch? Well ZeroGS requires **Pixel Shader 2.0** , so you
*need* a graphics card capable of this shader model (I recommend the
GeForce 6600GT for budget users).

The other catch is somewhat obvious, you will need a Dual Core CPU to
support MTGS mode, eg; AMD X2's, Opterons and of course the new
Conroe.

So when does this new ZeroGS come out? Well for now no ETA, and please
don't be nagging us about it!

Enough of the text, lets move onto my favorite section - eyecandy!

The shots where taken on the following spec machine:

-   Opteron 165 1.8Ghz @ 2.5Ghz (9x280)
-   1Gb DDR550 Dual Channel @ DDR560
-   Gainward BLISS 7900 GTX 512Mb
-   SoundBlaster Audigy 4

Note FPS is **reduced** by ~50% in these shots because they where taken
with Bilinear Filtering, and 4xAA enabled:
