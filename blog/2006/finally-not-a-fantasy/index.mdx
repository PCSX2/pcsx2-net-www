_Final Fantasy XII Demo_ that was released with _Dragon Quest VIII_ in
North America goes **ingame**!

<!-- truncate -->

Thanks to some recent work by _Refraction_ and a new contributor
_ZeroFrog_ , we can now walk around the first demo area of this game.
Given this is **VERY** early work in progress (W.I.P), there are some
major bugs to be ironed out, like various graphical issues!

However to celebrate this breakthrough, there is a video and several
screens, and be sure to check out the official forums for some
up-and-coming new shots, progress and general discussion!
