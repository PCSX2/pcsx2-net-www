In the **Good News for 0.9.2!** post, made on 16th August, Refraction
hinted at progress being made with the audio side of PCSX2, as many of
you will of guessed - the clip posted was from **Final Fantasy X** ,
more importantly from an FMV, which in all previous versions of PCSX2
had no audio (99% of the time).

To elaborate on this further; **GiGaHeRz** and **Saqib** have fixed
large portions of *ADMA* support, allowing for *all* videos to have
audio and many games now have full background music!

A little work has been done by **Saqib** today which allows for audio
and video sync when recording, so I can demonstrate with a small video
(xVid) - the results of their hard work.
