title: Good News For 0.9.2!
---

We have recently had **saqib** and **gigaherz** working very hard on
some... parts of pcsx2 and its plugins, the result? it should be rather
enjoyable for you when we release 0.9.2!

<!-- truncate -->

I'm not going to tell you what it is, I'm sure you die hard fans will
all guess from this sound clip

**Note:** The sound is a little choppy, but this is due to not running
it at quite full speed, plus background recording of the audio.

A big well done to **saqib** and **gigaherz** !
