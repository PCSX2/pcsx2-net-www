Yes i know this wasn't what people were expecting of an update from the
PCSX2 site,but small news is better than no news
ðŸ˜›
After some bugging by Falcon4ever,i sat down and fixed all 200 errors(
ðŸ˜› ) that were preventing the configuration guide
from being XHTML compatible
ðŸ˜Š You can check the validity by pressing the XHTML
button at the bottom of the page. So if anyone had problems with it with
the browser they were using,there is a good chance that its fixed
now.Note that all the translations have been made using the old html
file so unfortunately they are not XHTML compatible.

Also we have 2 new translations:

Indonesian translation by Exsharaen:
Panduan Pengaturan PCSX2

Italian translation by Master and corrected by Topper:
Guida alla configurazione di PCSX2

Great job and sorry for delaying the release of these 2 for some time
ðŸ˜‰
