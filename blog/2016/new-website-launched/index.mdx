title: New Website Launched!
---

After being in the works for half a year (
ðŸ˜› ) we finally got around making the new website
public!

<!-- truncate -->

Since we needed to upgrade to the latest Joomla 3, I decided to also
make the website look more modern and closer to our old, initial one. I
really liked the Dolphin website look, so you'll find some elements
close to their design
ðŸ˜Š

Here's what's changed:

- Now running the latest Joomla 3 platform
- New color scheme, matching the old PCSX2 website one that many
  people requested. You can switch to the previous dark theme from the
  Cpanel option at the upper right
- Latest boxes now using JS and switch their items instead of showing
  all 5 items at once (less space used, looks better)
- Larger random screenshot box and new screenshots added
- Removed right column, now only a single left column, more usable
  space
- News section now adapts to the detected resolution of your screen.
  Now the website should display much better with phones and adapt to
  larger resolutions as well (it's NOT responsive though..)
- Nicer compatibility overview bars
- New logo and fav icon! Thanks bmate
  ðŸ˜Š
- Many CSS fixes and cleanups

In general I tried giving the website a more game-y look and I think in
that regard it was a success
ðŸ˜Š

You can complain on how you don't like the new look, as usual, in this
thread!
