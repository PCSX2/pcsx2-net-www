I hope everybody out there is enjoying 0.9.4 and trying our new online
functionality, but for those of you who just managed to get some clean
underwear on after the excitement, we have some more news for you, so
underwear draw on standby.

<!-- truncate -->

From today we will be doing occasional public beta releases! Meaning
whatever is on the SVN, you will not have to wait for a year for us to
release it. But i will make one note _prepares bold, large text for the
few idiots who manage to miss it_

**WE WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING BETA BUILDS ON THE FORUM!**

I hope everybody can read that, we will not tollerate it, any threads
relating to it will be closed and unanswered.

That aside i hope you enjoy your new builds, but be sure to check back
occasionally as i won't be informing you of any updates
😉

Head over to the new "Public Beta" section of the downloads page to
grab it.

Enjoy!
