title: Dynasty Warriors And Fullmetal Alchemist Videos On 0.9.4!
---

Since its summer time and nothing much goes on these days (yes the devs
and testers also have lives!) I thought I'd entertain you with some
videos I recorded, showing off some of the new fixes in 0.9.4.

<!-- truncate -->

First and foremost, you'll notice perfect sound in both Dynasty
Warriors 4 Xtreme Legends and Fullmetal Alchemist 2 videos! Also,
Fullmetal Alchemist 2 did not even boot in 0.9.3 but with the SPU2 fixes
in 0.9.4 the game looks playable and I've already reached Chapter 2
with no problems at all.Note that the videos were taken using Bilinear
filtering and 4X AA and are sped up to 100% speed although they did run
pretty near that thanks to the new ZeroGS!

About progress I'll just say there are some new plugins in development
which have only seen null versions of until now, zeroGS 16:9 support and
the new bios format getting implemented (still not complete)
