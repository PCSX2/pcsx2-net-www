title: PCSX2 Magazine Appearance

Recently **PCSX2** has made its second appearance in the Italian
magazine - _The Games Machine_ . It's great to see PCSX2 getting
mention in publications, and we thought we'd share the article with
you!

If you can read Italian, you can click on the thumbnail to the left and
read it yourself, for those of you who can't read Italian, a rough
translation is below (Made by a friend of the PCSX2 team!):

\*"Some time ago we talked about PS2 emulation and we mentioned that
PCSX2 had made a lot of progress, but that it was still impossible to
"play".

Things have changed a lot and now PCSX2, that is the result of more than
2 years of developing, is the only emulator that can emulate the PS2 in
a good way. The hardware requirements are very high, we are talking
about an Intel E6600 or an equivalent AMD, 1 GB of ram and a video card
with full support of Pixel Shader 2.0.

The requirements are very high but not absurd if you are thinking a bout
an upgrade to Windows Vista. PCSX2, the latest release 0.9.2, is based
on some plugins which emulate the functions of PCSX2.

On the official site of the project ( <http://pcsx2.net> ) you can find
a very complete guide to the use of the emu. Personally, I can recommend
you the new ZeroGS 0.96.0 (a video plugin). It's a plugin which works
very well only with newer graphics cards. There are specific plugins
just for audio,controller, USB and for Firewire emulation. There are
also a lot of CDVD plugins.

If you want to use PCSX2 you must have a "real ps2" and its bios. You
can obtain it dumping it from your ps2 (any other way is against the
law).

PCSX2 is compatible with a lot of famous games like: GTA San Andreas,
Devil May Cry 3, Final Fantasy X... The framerate is very low on a lot
of PC's but buying a very powerful pc, the framerate problem is going
to end in the coming months.

At the end PCSX2 is a very good product and it'll have for sure an
evolution thanks to the hardware evolution."\*
