Whilst the Linux users out there get to enjoy PlayStation 2 emulation
for the first time in awhile with **PCSX2 0.9.3** , I'm sure both
Windows and Linux users wonder what lies in store with **PCSX2 0.9.4**.

<!-- truncate -->

First off, before I get to the seductive eye candy, a small but
_important_ note for our Brazilian users:

The VM (PCSX2 Virtual Memory Build) issues under Windows XP you have
experienced with **PCSX2 0.9.2** have been fixed in **0.9.4** thanks to
some work by Refraction.

I dare say the term "Path 3" doesn't mean a great deal to most of the
people visiting this site, however "Path 3" is part of GS/GIF (the
interface for GS) and is often used in the handling of textures and
environment effects.

Refraction has been doing a great deal of research / coding with regards
to path 3. Many games now are **no longer** suffering from garbage
textures, texture flicker and other miscellaneous issues.

Whilst these fixes have **far reaching** effects, from games no longer
displaying "split-repeating IPU" (multiple copies of the same frame on
screen), to subtle fixes like _Final Fantasy 12_ having fixed menu
backgrounds, below is a selection of shots from games that have seen
dramatic improvement! **Click on Image to See Larger Version!**
