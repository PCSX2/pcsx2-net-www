title: The Penguin Returns - 0.9.3 Linux Release
---

Well linux users, we promised we'd have you back and here is the living
breathing proof!

<!-- truncate -->

Along with this release you have a couple of new plugins exclusively!

- **ZeroPAD** - New pad plugin based off Twinpad, PADWinkeyb and
  SSSPSX Pad.
- **ZeroGS OGL** - An OpenGL conversion of ZeroGS. No more GSSoft for
  youðŸ˜‰

You also have available a 32bit and 64bit build for your pleasure, we do
spoil you sometimes! Take note the 64bit version is far from finished!
The next release will be much quicker than the current
implementation...

**WINDOWS USERS** :- I have some bad news for you, there will be no
0.9.3 for windows, **BUT** Before you go crying to mummy that we've
been picking on you, you will see 0.9.4 very soon, we have some 64bit
bugs in windows to sort out, along with some excellent fixes for games
such as **Grand Theft Auto - San Andreas** so it will be worth the
wait.

As a consolation, if you are in to Dreamcast emulation, the long awaited
**nullDC** has just been released, you can grab it
[here](http://forums.ngemu.com/nulldc-forum/87533-nulldc-v1-0-0-public-beta-1-a.html)

Just to excite you a little more, here are a few shots I've taken with
some of the new fixes for 0.9.4. Enjoy ðŸ˜Š
