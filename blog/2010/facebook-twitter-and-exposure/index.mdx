**PCSX2 Used in Test:**

The first is a mention from our friends at Eurogamer and Kotaku! PCSX2
was used in an experiment to see what ICO and Shadow of the Colossus
would be like if they were re-released on the PS3 in HD (Note, they did
NOT use the PS3's upscaling ability
😛 ), Check out these articles below.

(Thanks for Parotaku for finding these)

emulator
