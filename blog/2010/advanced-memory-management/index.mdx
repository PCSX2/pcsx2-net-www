Being an emulator of a fairly robust system (the PS2), PCSX2 typically
consumes a *lot* of system RAM. It needs multitudes of caches and
buffers for various things. Just to give an idea, I'll list some of the
larger stuff and their current defaults:

<!-- truncate -->

-   PS2 main memory \[32mb\]
-   IOP memory \[2mb\]
-   EE/IOP BIOS roms \[6mb\]
-   Scratchpad, Hardware registers, VU memory, DMA buffers, etc \[4mb\]
-   VTLB indexes, lookups, and protection tables \[8mb\]
-   EE/R5900 recompiler cache \[16mb\]
-   EE/R5900 recompiler block/pc translation table \[48mb\]
-   R5900 memory protection mirror \[32mb\]
-   IOP/R3000A recompiler cache and translation table \[10mb\]
-   microVU recompiler code caches \[16mb \* 2\]
-   superVU recompiler code caches \[8mb\]


If all of these things are reserved when PCSX2 starts, we have a base
memory footprint of over 200 megs before even a single instruction of
PS2 code is executed! The worst part is that we could really stand to
allocate *even more* ram: some games need over 120 mb of recompiler
caches to run properly. Currently those games are dealt with by issuing
periodic recompiler resets (sluggish).

Fortunately modern operating systems have a lot of built-in features
that help us out. Both Windows and Linux OSes use *virtual memory
mapping* features of our Intel/AMD cpus to perform "virtual" allocations
of large memory reserves. What this means is that initially the
allocated memory has no actual *physical* equivalent. It is only given a
physical presence once the memory is accessed (read or written).
Explained as a process:

1. App requests 1gb of RAM via malloc.
2. Operating system "reserves" the 1gb of RAM, which marks the virtual
addresses for use by this memory only. In this case the memory might be
reserved from 0x10000000 (0.4gb) -&gt; 0x50000000 (1.4gb).
3. Operating system "commits" the 1gb of RAM, ensuring there is enough
physical and swapfile RAM to accommodate it. No actual memory or
swapfile changes are made; only the tracked amount of ram/swap in
reserve is altered.
3. App receives a pointer to the reserved ram.
4. App reads or writes data -- 128mb worth, let's say.
5. OS receives a *page fault* exception for that memory, and allocates a
chunk of *physical* RAM for it. Other processes may be swapped out to
disk at this time to make room for the memory in-use.

Only at Point 5 does any actual physical ram get used by the program.
Prior to Point 5, the app has used exactly 0 byte of RAM, in spite of
allocating 1gb via **malloc** . This feature is implicit to both Windows
and Linux and already helps work wonders on PCSX2's overall memory
footprint. This is also why you might get "Low on virtual memory!"
errors even though it appears as though you have lots of free ram in the
System Monitor / Process Explorer, because some apps commit lots of
memory but only actually access a small fraction of it.

There are ways, however, to fine tune memory access and get even better
memory management than the implicit Windows / Linux provisions via
malloc. The first rule is a simple one, but one many programmers
probably have no idea about it:

**Do not use calloc, and do not clear allocated memory by default unless you absolutely have to!**

Calling **calloc** instead of **malloc** causes the entire allocation
(1gb in our above example) to be committed to physical memory because of
its being cleared to zero. Likewise, manually clearing buffers to zero
(or some other value) has the same effect. Even if only a small portion
of the array ends up being used later on, its too late: the whole thing
is sucking up resources for no good reason except to express a patterned
fill value. Sometimes clearing buffers cannot be avoided, but most of
the time buffers need not be cleared at all, and programmers simply use
calloc or manual clears out of habit.

**Using Reserve and Commit to manage recompiled code buffers.**

There are two phases to allocating memory on a virtual memory system, as
noted in the small ordered list above. By default, **malloc** will
*reserve* and *commit* ram together. This is done so that the system can
ensure that there is enough ram and swap to free to give the program the
entire allocation -- *if* it happens to ever need it. If the *commit*
phase fails due to there not being enough physical ram, **malloc**
returns NULL. If you manage the reserve and commit phases separately,
then you can reserve extra large swatches of memory addresses without
affecting the rest of the operating system in any way; and then later on
commit portions of the reserve only as needed. There aren't a whole lot
of reasons why you'd need to micro-manage the virtual memory system in
this way, and for most purposes simply using malloc and letting the OS
do its own internal management suffices nicely. Lucky for us, PCSX2 has
one!

One of the troubles with recompiled code is that it can't be allowed to
*move* . Typically use of **malloc** and **realloc** results in
allocated memory moving around as it grows or shrinks. This is fine for
most purposes, but is disastrous to executable code since it invalidates
all block pointers and long jumps (which use absolute addressing). In
order to grow a recompiled code cache using traditional malloc, you have
to clear the cache and start over -- a recompiler reset. This usually
causes a lengthy hiccup in emulation speed when it happens.

Virtual memory techniques can be used to get around that. When we
reserve the recompiled code cache, we reserve the upper limit of what we
deem a sane cache size. In this case, the R5900 cache should be a
maximum of 48mb. The 48mb is reserved from 0x30000000-&gt;0x33000000
when PCSX2 starts, the first 4mb are *committed* when PCSX2 starts
executing R5900 code. When the cache fills, PCSX2 automatically commits
more memory in 128k increments, up to 48mb -- at which point the
emulator will reset the cache and start over. Thanks to the virtual
memory strategy described above, only a fraction of the 48meg allocation
actually *exists* in physical ram unless more of the allocation is
actually needed. Furthermore, computers with limited RAM resources or
disabled swapfiles will still be able to run PCSX2 nicely.

Committing blocks of memory from the 48meg reserve never alters the base
address of the memory, so no pointers become invalid, and no memory
needs to be copied or shuffled in order to make room for the larger
caches. The end result is near instantaneous increases in cache size,
on-the-fly! ... and all-the-while maintaining compact and efficient
memory footprint for games that don't need more than the basic caches.

On Windows this technique is implemented using
[VirtualAlloc](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa366887.aspx) ,
which is fairly well documented via the linked MSDN page. On Linux,
however, things get a bit strange. The technique can be implemented
using a combination of
[mmap](http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man2/mmap.2.html)
and
[mprotect](http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man2/mprotect.2.html)
, but unfortunately the Linux man pages lack any actual explanation of
how to perform independent reserve and commit actions (but rest assured,
it can be done). Furthermore, Linux has an implicit system enabled by
default called **Over-committing** , which basically skips phase (3)
described above -- and always returns a valid pointer on calls to
malloc, even if the system hasn't enough ram to accommodate the
request.

Over-committing is so surpassingly hacky and evil that it deserves a
blog post all to itself, so stay tuned.
