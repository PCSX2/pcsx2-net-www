---

After more than a year since the last stable 0.9.6 release and 8 months since the last beta release of PCSX2, the new beta version is finally ready!
The most notable change is the all new GUI powered by wxWidgets, but the
amount of improvements in this release is really amazing

This 0.9.7 release is marked as unstable/beta, meaning it still has some
known bugs and unimplemented features but it is fully supported by the
PCSX2 team. For more info, check the included readme file.

Without further delay, here's the extensive changelog:
