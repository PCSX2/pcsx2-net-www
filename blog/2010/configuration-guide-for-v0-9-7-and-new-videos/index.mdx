title: Configuration Guide For V0.9.7 And New Videos

I finally got around updating the now (huge) configuration guide for the
new beta version of PCSX2 v0.9.7!
You can read it

<!-- truncate -->

As usual, we would love to have as many translations as possible, so if
you are up to it, please apply
[here](http://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-Guide-translation-applications).

We also revamped our video section with 11 new gameplay videos using
0.9.7 courtesy of yours truly, Shadow Lady, Rudy_X and rama.

That's all for now!
