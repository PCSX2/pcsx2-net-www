title: The Return Of The Commandline
---

After its absence for many moons, the Commandline functionality will
finally be restored to PCSX2. Third-party frontend and config-manager
authors rejoice! ... and hopefully stop hating my guts, too.

<!-- truncate -->

To paraphrase Darth Vader: **"Witness the power of this fully armed and
operational Command line-driven battlestation."**

_(we all know a command line-driven death star would have been way
cooler than some click-and-drag crap.)_

The new PCSX2 command line should be functional in our next beta
release, which should be out pretty soon, and it will work as follows:

Syntax: **pcsx2 \[IsoFile\] --toggle --option=value ... etc**

- IsoFile - optional ISO image to load and run on startup; uses the
  PCSX2 internal ISO loader.

General Options :

- --cfg=\[file\] {specify a custom configuration file to use instead
  of PCSX2.ini (does not affect plugins)}
- --cfgpath=\[dir\] {specifies the config folder; applies to pcsx2 +
  plugins}
- --help {display this help text}
- --forcewiz {forces running of the First-time Wizard (selection of
  docs folders and what-not)}

Auto-Run Options :

- --elf=\[file\] {executes an ELF image}
- --nogui {disables display of the gui on exit (program auto-exits)}
- --nodisc {boots with an empty dvd tray; use this to boot into the
  PS2 system menu}
- --usecd {uses the configured CDVD plugin instead of IsoFile}

Compatibility Options:

- --nohacks {disables all speedhacks}
- --gamefixes=\[fix,fix\] {Enable specific gamefixes for this session.
  Valid fixes in 0.9.7 are: VuAddSub, VuClipFlag, FpuCompare,
  FpuNegDiv, XGKick, IpuWait, EETiming, SkipMpeg }
- --fullboot {disables the quick boot feature, forcing you to sit
  through the PS2 startup splash screens}

Plugin Overrides (specified dlls will be used in place of configured
dlls):

- --cdvd=\[dllpath\] {override for the CDVD plugin}
- --gs=\[dllpath\] {override for the GS plugin}
- --spu=\[dllpath\] {override for the SPU2 plugin}
- --pad=\[dllpath\] {override for the PAD plugin only}
- --dev9=\[dllpath\] {override for the DEV9 plugin}
- --usb=\[dllpath\] {override for the USB plugin only}
