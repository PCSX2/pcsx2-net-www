It has been a long time since the last news concerning PCSX2, so I
thought I'd bring you up to date

Development of the new 0.9.7 version of the emulator with the all new GUI is going strong and soon all the old GUI functionality will be implemented. After that it's bug hunting time and then a beta release!

new GUI builds, for those of you who haven't checked it out yet!

- Threaded GUI, for better responsiveness, usability and error
  handling
- Simplified plugin configuration dialog, with more options
- Console output will no longer slow down the emulator when flooded
  thanks to threading
- Saving states done in the new thread, so gameplay doesn't even
  flinch when you save

- New Speed hacks configuration, with more warnings ( like anyone
  reads them!) and a restore defaults button
- All options have tooltips (text that appears after you leave the
  cursor on a control for some secs) explaining what each of them do
- Screen shot button in every dialog (lower left corner) to easily
  take shots of your configurations

That's it! Hope you like the new look and functionality, we are doing
our best to make PCSX2 as user friendly as possible. Of course there are
still some features not shown here, we have to keep something to
surprise you!

There is no set date for the beta release, since there are still a bunch
of bugs lying around but it's safe to say we are getting close
