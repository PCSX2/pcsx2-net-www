[PSEmu.pl](http://www.psemu.pl/) run by the respected and fine admin
**winter_mute** , will be providing the official **Polish** language
forums for the PCSX2 project!

Some of you may of been expecting a release the end of last month, this
was the original intention of the team, but recent changes caused compat
issues and needed further in depth testing. The aim is to get a release
out soon, but how soon depends on various major changes!

Some of these changes if fixed and tested to be 'stable' will provide
a good deal of ....well dare I say it... speed!
