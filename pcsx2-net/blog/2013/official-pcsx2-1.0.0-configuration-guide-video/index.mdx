title: Official PCSX2 1.0.0 Configuration Guide Video
---

After popular demand, I decided to create a video for everyone who
prefers following a configuration step by step instead of reading one.
Also, since there are tons of 'best' configuration videos for PCSX2
floating around the web, it should be better to have an official one
which we will support
😊

<!-- truncate -->

If there is enough demand, I might create additional videos for speed
configurations or high end/quality configurations. **Set quality to
1080p** and enjoy!
😊
