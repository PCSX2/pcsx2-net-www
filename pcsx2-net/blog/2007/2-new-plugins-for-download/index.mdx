Okay, they aren't new, they have been on NGemu a while, but they have
been getting some good support from the community and i felt they needed

Due to the hard work of **Rebel_X** and **ChickenLiver** from the PCSX2
forums, we are proud to present **LilyPad** and **TwinPad** plugins,
which both allow keyboard users to have full use of the analog sticks!
I'm sure you will enjoy them as much as the forum users have.
