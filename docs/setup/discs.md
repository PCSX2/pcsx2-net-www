This page helps you create a backup of your physical game disc.

## General Information

Although you can play games on PCSX2 directly from your disc, there are major advantages[^advantages] to dumping them and using those backup files instead. PlayStation 2 game discs are unencrypted DVDs and CDs[^format] which can be dumped quickly using a standard [optical disc drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_disc_drive) that supports DVD and CD media.[^odd] The dumping process is straightforward for all skill levels and does not harm optical media.

:::tip[Tip – Bad dumps]

- Game dumps that aren't identical copies of the original game are called "bad dumps".
- These can cause issues such as freezing on loading screens.
- If you have trouble with your game disc, consider selecting a lower [drive speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_storage_media_writing_and_reading_speed).
- Lower drive speeds take much more time but raise the likelihood of a "good dump" (exact copy).
- Once PCSX2 is installed, you can [easily verify that your game was successfully dumped.](../troubleshooting/general#game-are-stuck-on-black-screen-or-does-not-load-correctly)
  :::

## Creating Disc Dumps

:::note[Note – CD dumps]

- macOS and Linux users dumping CDs (blue discs) rather than DVDs (silver discs) will need to select guides marked `[CD]` or `[DVD/CD]`.[^bin-cue]
- All Windows instructions apply to both DVDs and CDs.
  :::

<Tabs queryString="os">
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>

Disc dumping on Windows can be done using graphical tools like Media Preservation Frontend (MPF) and ImgBurn.

<Tabs queryString="tool">
<TabItem value="mpf" label="MPF" default>

Media Preservation Frontend (MPF) is a streamlined, free and open-source graphical tool aimed at preserving optical media.

:::tip[Tip – Downloading MPF]

- [Download the Windows x64 UI version of MPF](https://github.com/SabreTools/MPF/releases) – named `MPF.UI_[a.b.c]_net[x.y]_windows_win-x64_release.zip`.
- Extract MPF from the `.zip` archive.
  <Image

  alt="A package download page on GitHub. Highlighted is the package MPF.UI_3.3.3_net9.0-windows_win-x64_release.zip, used as an example."
  />
  :::

Once you've placed the game into an optical drive and opened MPF:

1. Click `Scan for Discs`.
   - This should automatically populate MPF with information about your disc.
   - If it fails to populate, you can enter the information manually instead:
     - Under "System/Media Type", select "Sony PlayStation 2".
     - Select whether your game disc is on a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM.
     - Under "Drive Letter", select the letter corresponding to your optical drive.
2. (Optional) Under "Output Path", specify a destination folder and file name for the dump.
   - The default destination is a folder called `ISO` in the same folder as `MPF.exe`.
   - The default file name is the disc volume name with an extension.
3. Click `Start Dumping` once the Status reads "ready to dump".
4. A command line window will open and begin running the utility [Redumper](https://github.com/superg/redumper).
5. Wait for the dumping process to complete.
6. Click `OK` on the message stating: "It is now safe to eject the disc."
7. Click `Cancel` on the "Disc Information" window.

Your game will be in the destination folder you specified, and you can safely remove the game disc from the optical drive.

Directly to the left of the Scan for Discs button is a button labeled Start Dumping (step 3).

Once you've placed your game disc into an optical drive and opened a terminal:

1. Run `cdrdao` with the following syntax:
   ```bash
   cdrdao read-cd --read-raw --datafile [dump-name].bin [dump-name].toc
   ```
   :::info[Info – Command breakdown]
   - Reads a CD as 2352-byte blocks (`--read-raw`) from your CD drive using a generic driver.
   - Creates separate `.bin` and `.toc` files which you name by replacing "[dump-name]".
     :::
2. Wait for the dumping process to complete.

Your game will be in the destination folder you specified, and you can safely remove the game disc from the optical drive.

:::tip[Tip – `.toc` and `.cue` files]

- PCSX2 [does not currently support](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/issues/4880) reading `.toc` or `.cue` files.
- If you want, you can still convert your `.toc` file to `.cue` by running:

```bash
toc2cue [dump-name].toc [dump-name].cue
```

## Footnotes

[^advantages]: Advantages of dumping include no noise from the optical drive, no need for your computer to be connected to an optical drive while playing, no need to physically swap between discs or for them to be physically present, and the ability to curate a games library within PCSX2.

[^format]: This is typically ISO 9660 with UDF 1.02 for DVDs and simply ISO 9660 for CDs.

[^odd]: If you do not own an optical disc drive, the easiest option is to purchase or borrow an external optical drive which connects via USB (typically 15–30 USD). Larger PlayStation 2 games use a dual-layer [DVD-9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD#Capacity) format, which most optical drives manufactured in the last 25 years support.

[^bin-cue]: DVDs are burned to `.iso` files, but because `.iso` files only store one audio track and because CDs use a different size for [data sectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_sector), some CD-based games break if they are dumped in this format. Instead, CDs should be dumped to separate `.bin` and `.cue`/`.toc` files. A `.bin` file is the binary, while the `.cue`/`.toc` is a small plaintext file containing audio track metadata. PCSX2 [does not currently support](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/issues/4880) reading `.cue`/`.toc` files.
