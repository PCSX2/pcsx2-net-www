This page helps you dump the BIOS files from your PlayStation 2 console.

These files are proprietary software and must therefore be dumped from your own console. PCSX2 cannot play games without a BIOS, and no open-source alternative exists. However, thanks to the hard work of the homebrew community, dumping the BIOS today is a one-time, streamlined process.

## Overview

Dumping your PlayStation 2 BIOS is conceptually a two-step process:

1. Modify the operation of your PS2 so that it can run any program.
2. Run a BIOS dumper utility program on your PS2 that reads its BIOS and writes it to an external device such as a USB drive.

## Modifying Your PS2

First, you will need to modify your PlayStation 2 device's operation so that it can run a BIOS dumping program. Below are several methods to accomplish this, among which we most heavily recommend FreeMcBoot or FreeDVDBoot. These two are software modifications ("softmods") which live on a PS2 memory card and DVD, respectively, and do not permanently alter your PlayStation 2 console. Fortuna is a similar softmod to FreeMcBoot, but it is somewhat harder to find and use.

:::caution[Caution – Modchip dump corruption]

- An active modchip may cause an incomplete or corrupted BIOS dump.
- To guarantee an accurate BIOS dump:
  1. Use your modchip to install FreeMcBoot or Fortuna.
  2. Disable your modchip and use uLaunchELF to launch biosdrain as described below.
- Refer to your modchip's documentation to see what button combination disables your modchip.

### Downloading biosdrain

:::info[Info – biosdrain download]
The download for the latest stable release of biosdrain is [here](https://github.com/f0bes/biosdrain/releases/latest/download/biosdrain.elf).
:::

The BIOS dumper utility we recommend is [biosdrain](https://github.com/F0bes/biosdrain). It will run on your PS2 during the dumping process but does not in any way alter your PS2. The instructions below assume you're using this tool.

<Image
src={require("./img/bios/biosdrain.webp").default}
alt="A mostly black screen reads biosdrain - revision v2.1.1 in the upper-right. The biosdrain logo in the bottom-right features the text {BIOSDRAIN} and has a picture of the Bongo Cat meme."
/>

### Starting uLaunchELF

FreeMcBoot and FreeDVDBoot bundle a generally useful homebrew program, uLaunchELF,[^wLaunchELF] that lets you browse memory cards, DVDs, and USB drives connected to your PS2 and run programs from them.

<Tabs queryString="softmod">
 <TabItem value="freemcboot" label="Using FreeMcBoot" default>

1. Insert the FreeMcBoot memory card into Memory Card Slot 1.
2. Make sure the disc tray is empty.
3. Turn on your PS2.
4. Select uLaunchELF from the menu.

 </TabItem>
 <TabItem value="freedvdboot" label="Using FreeDVDBoot">

1. Download the ISO which corresponds to your PS2 model from [FreeDVDBoot's GitHub repository](https://github.com/CTurt/FreeDVDBoot/tree/master/PREBUILT%20ISOs).
2. Burn the ISO to a DVD.
   - The most generally reliable media is a DVD-R disc burned at a slow speed (e.g. 4X speed).
3. Make sure your PS2's language is set to English.
4. Place the burned FreeDVDBoot disc into your PS2.
5. Reset/turn on your PS2.
6. uLaunchELF should open.

## Dumping the BIOS

### Creating the BIOS Dump

biosdrain supports dumping both to a USB flash drive and via HOST through ps2link. We recommend USB for most users. If your console does not have networking support, you cannot use the ps2link method.

<Tabs queryString="medium">
 <TabItem value="usb" label="USB Flash Drive" default>

:::note[Note – USB issues]

- Some incompatibilities exist between certain USB drives and PS2 USB drivers.
  - If your USB drive is not detected by uLaunchELF (`mass:` is empty) please try another flash drive, preferably USB 2.0.
- USB transfer on the PlayStation 2 is _slow_. Please be patient.
  :::

To use the USB method, you will need a USB flash drive which is partitioned as [master boot record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record) (MBR) and formatted with a [FAT32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table) filesystem.

On Windows, we recommend the free and open-source tool Rufus.

:::danger[Danger – Data loss]
Rufus is a powerful tool which can easily cause permanent data loss if misused.

- Formatting a flash drive _permanently wipes_ all of its data.
- Make absolutely sure that you do not format another drive by accident.
- Do not format a flash drive if it contains any data you want to keep.
  :::

1. [Download Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/), preferably the latest 'Portable' version.
2. Plug your USB flash drive into your computer.
3. Open Rufus.
4. Make sure the drive selected under "Device" is the USB flash drive you wish to format.
5. Under "Boot selection", select the option "Non bootable".
6. Make sure "Partition scheme" is set to "MBR".
7. Make sure "File system" is set to "FAT32 (Default)" or "Large FAT32 (Default)".
8. Click `Start`.
9. Wait for the process to finish.

You can now exit Rufus and proceed.

### Checking the BIOS Dump

Once you've finished dumping your PS2's BIOS, you're done and ready to use it for PCSX2. However, if you wish to first verify the integrity of the dump, the ReDump project maintains [a data file](https://redump.org/datfile/ps2-bios/) containing [hashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) for every PS2 BIOS version. To compute the SHA1 hash of the BIOS file you dumped:

On Windows, [use Get-FileHash in PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/get-filehash?view=powershell-7.5):
