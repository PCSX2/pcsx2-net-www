This page helps you download and run PCSX2. PCSX2 is offered both as a Stable build which is updated every several months and as a Nightly build which is updated continually as PCSX2 is developed.

:::info[Info ‚Äì Stable and nightly builds]
Use the Stable build if you:

- Do not want to be prompted for updates.
- Use an operating system which is rarely updated.
- Want minimal risk of [regressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_regression).

Use the Nightly build if you:

- Want improvements as soon as they're released.
- Need to ask the team for support.
- Wish to contribute to PCSX2.

## Downloading and Running

<Tabs queryString="os">
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>

PCSX2 on Windows can be used either as an installation (Stable only) or as a portable program (Stable and Nightly). The installer is more streamlined, while the portable version gives you more flexibility.

:::note[Note ‚Äì Visual C++]
PCSX2 on Windows requires that you have the [latest x64 Visual C++ runtime](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?#latest-microsoft-visual-c-redistributable-version) installed.
:::

<Tabs queryString="format">

- Double-click the `.exe` file which you downloaded.
- Windows will ask if you want to run this program. Click "Yes".
- Follow the instructions in the setup wizard, and you are ready to play!

:::tip[Tip ‚Äì Uninstalling]
If you need to uninstall PCSX2, follow [this guide from Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uninstall-or-remove-apps-and-programs-in-windows-4b55f974-2cc6-2d2b-d092-5905080eaf98) for uninstalling programs.
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="portable" label="Portable">

- Download the latest PCSX2 build for Windows from the [Download page](https://pcsx2.net/downloads).
  - The portable version will be called "Download".
- Use [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) to extract the `.7z` archive.
  - Install 7-Zip.
  - Right-click on the archive.
  - Find the entry for 7-Zip.
  - Click `Extract to "[archive name]\"` to extract PCSX2 into its own folder.
    <Image

:::tip[Tip ‚Äì Portability and extraction]

- If you want PCSX2 to save its data files to this extracted folder instead of the default (`Documents`), create a blank file in the folder named `portable.ini` or `portable.txt`.
- On Windows 11 version 23H2 or later, you can extract 7-Zip archives natively without installing 7-Zip by clicking `Extract All...`.

:::note[Note ‚Äì FFmpeg libraries]

- PCSX2 requires additional [FFmpeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFmpeg) libraries if you wish to use its built-in video capture.
  - Download the FFmpeg Windows files [here](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2-windows-dependencies/releases/tag/FFMPEG).
  - Extract the contents of the `.zip` file.
  - Place the extracted `.dll` files in the same folder as the PCSX2 `.exe` file.

:::tip[Tip ‚Äì Application name]
PCSX2's application name will change to reflect version updates. If you don't want the name to change during updates, rename the application to remove the version number.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

PCSX2 on Linux is officially supported through an AppImage version and a Flatpak version.

<Tabs queryString="format">
<TabItem value="appimage" label="AppImage" default>

- Download the latest PCSX2 AppImage build from the [Download page](https://pcsx2.net/downloads).
- You may need to make the AppImage file executable.
  - To do this in the shell, run:
    ```bash
    chmod +x [path-to-AppImage-file]
    ```
  - Doing this graphically in your file manager varies by distro, but generally:
    - Right-click on the AppImage.
    - Click `Properties`.
    - Find and check a box marking the file as executable.

<TabItem value="flatpak" label="Flatpak">

PCSX2 is available on [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/net.pcsx2.PCSX2)! You can install PCSX2 from Flathub through one of several compatible graphical package managers or through the shell.

:::caution[Caution ‚Äì Flatpak issues]

- Due to limitations of the [Portal API](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/portal-api-reference.html) for sandboxing, the Flatpak version sometimes has bugs not present in the AppImage version.
- These issues are usually related to accessing files.
  :::

<Tabs queryString="interface">
<TabItem value="graphical" label="Graphical" default>

Many distributions and desktop environments have a graphical package manager which can install and update Flatpak applications. [These include](https://flatpak.org/setup/):

- KDE Plasma's Discover
- GNOME Software
- Linux Mint's Software Manager
- Manjaro's pamac
- Pop!\_OS' Repoman
- elementary OS' AppCenter
- Bazaar (e.g. on Bazzite)

Once you've installed PCSX2 using one of these, it should be in your list of applications. Open PCSX2, follow the setup wizard, and you are ready to play! You can use this package manager to keep PCSX2 updated in the future.
