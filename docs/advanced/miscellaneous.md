## Using GDB with Linux AppImages (32 bit and 64 bit)

This guide is useful if for example you'd like to debug a 32 bit crash but cannot build a 32 bit PCSX2.

1. **Put your AppImage into a directory by itself**

   We'll call the AppImage `PCSX2.AppImage` and then navigate your terminal to this directory..

2. **Extract the contents of the AppImage**

   You can do this by doing `./PCSX2.AppImage --appimage-extract`

   A new directory called `squashfs-root` should have been created.

3. **Run the AppImage normally**

   `./PCSX2.AppImage`

4. **Get the PID of the current PCSX2 instance**

   You can do `pidof PCSX2`.

   If there is more than one pid that shows up, you have more than one PCSX2 running!

   We'll call your running pid `<PID>`

5. **Attach GDB (during a fault or when PCSX2 is running normally, doesn't matter)**

   :::note
   You might need to run gdb with `sudo`
   :::

   `gdb squashfs-root/usr/bin/PCSX2 -p <PID>`

   `set sysroot ./squashfs-root`

   `set solib-search-path ./squashfs-root/usr/lib`

   The last two commands are due to the fact that the AppImage runs in a sanboxed area.
   It points gdb to where PCSX2 is going to look for libraries for example.

The commands in-order are listed below:

```sh
./PCSX2.AppImage --appimage-extract

./PCSX2.AppImage

pidof PCSX2

gdb squashfs-root/usr/bin/PCSX2 -p <PID>

set sysroot ./squashfs-root

set solib-search-path ./squashfs-root/usr/lib
```

You now have GDB set up and connected to your PCSX2

## Viewing Windows Minidumps on Other Platform

If you're on Windows, the best way to view crash dumps is to open them in Visual Studio. Therefore, you can ignore these instructions if you are on Windows.

:::warning
You will need the user's crash dump (.dmp) file, and the symbols (.pdb) and executable (.exe) of PCSX2 that is the _exact_ version the user was using when the crash dump was generated.
:::

### Dependencies

First off, you will need the `cargo` package manager for rust. Optionally you can build the dependencies from source, but it's much simpler relying on cargo.

Install the crates [dump_syms](https://crates.io/crates/dump_syms) and [minidump-stackwalk](https://crates.io/crates/minidump-stackwalk)

```bash
cargo install dump_syms minidump-stackwalk
```

Depending on your system, you may need to add the cargo bin directory to `$PATH`, please consult your system specific documentation on how to do this.

### Generating the Symbols

`minidump-stackwalk` doesn't support pdb files. This is where `dump_syms` come in handy.

`dump_syms` will take all available information from the executable and PDB file and convert it into a format `minidump-stackwalk` can interpret. `dump_syms` emits the symbols to STDOUT, so pipe that to a brand new file.

```bash
dump_syms pcsx2-qt.exe pcsx2-qt.pdb > dumped_symbols.txt
```

### Reading the minidump

```sh
minidump-stackwalk pcsx2-qt.dmp --symbols-path dumped_symbols.txt
```

:::tip
You can optionally pass `--features=unstable-all` if you'd like to see if `minidump-stackwalk` can provide more information.
:::

The output will be the stack trace of the minidump. if you are lucky, then the thread list will show what thread has crashed, and then you can find the cause from the stack trace. **Usually the first call(s) will be in the kernel**, don't write off the call stack though, it's very important to go back until you find the first call stack that is in our code!

In the example given below, we can find that an assertion was called (#6) in the startVM function (#7). Because of our debugging information, it even tells us the exact lines in code where this happened.
