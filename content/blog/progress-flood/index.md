A lot is going on behind the scenes these days so without further ado
here's our news:

-   PCSX2 has a brand new GUI *in development!* We will be using
    **[wxWidgets](https://www.wxwidgets.org/)** for cross-platform
    compatibility and speedier dev cycles. However it won't be ready for
    beta for some time. For further info read the blog titled
    **[Measuring the Benefits of wxWidgets](/developer-blog/213-measuring-the-benefits-of-wxwidgets.html)**
-   A Final beta has been released using the current PCSX2 GUI. It has
    tons of improvements over the old one, mainly on microVU which is
    now almost complete. Get it from our downloads section.
-   First time we release a Linux beta, courtesy of
    **[Arcum42](https://forums.pcsx2.net/User-arcum42)** , found in the
    above link as well.
-   Blog posts now allow user comments in our forum! Discussions
    surrounding the development part of PCSX2 are going strong in **[the
    new forum](https://forums.pcsx2.net/Forum-Developer-Discussion)**
-   **Major** work on the site even if you can't see it. New Guide
    page, updated **About**, updated Contact, **all** pages XHTML
    valid, Compatibility list filter/go button fixed and cross-browser compatibility.
-   New, extremely detailed Compile
    Wiki, courtesy of **[n1ckn4m3](https://forums.pcsx2.net/User-n1ckn4m3)**.
-   New forum plugins, added recaptcha 2 for spam protection, auto image
    resizing,users browsing thread and favorite icon. Fixes for the Dark
    theme, which should now look perfect in all browsers

  
As development of the new GUI is currently under way, the trunk of our
SVN will have a very alpha PCSX2 which you should only use for testing or just out of curiosity. For a
bleeding edge usable PCSX2 for the time being use the last released beta.  
  
That's all for now!
