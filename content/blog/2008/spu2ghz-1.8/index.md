I'm (ab)using the pcsx2.net's news system to let everyone know I
(finally) got my lazy ass to make some improvements in my sound plugin.

The result is spu2ghz 1.8, which you can find in [the official thread in
our forums](http://forums.pcsx2.net/thread-2352.html) .

I will keep working on the SPDIF decoding, and hopefully someday I will
manage to get working AC3/DTS playback.

EDIT: I uploaded the file also to [sourceforge.net's file release
system](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=87426) for
anyone who can't access the forums, or doesn't want to register in
them.
