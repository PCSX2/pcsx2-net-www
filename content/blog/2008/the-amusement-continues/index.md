The new version of PCSX2 is out, development continues, ideas flow
through the team and new ideas for fun spring to mind, just to forget
about the work at hand for five minutes! This time, in the form of a
video containing "misheard lyrics". We all listen to songs and sometimes
completely miss the correct lyrics in a song, but i decided to go one
step further with this following number and see what i could make in
english out of a song which is sung in sweedish (afaik). The idea came
around after Falcon4ever was thinking of ideas for a 404 page on a
subdomain of ours to wind up one of the other team members, with the use
of an annoying song.

Well, needless to say, it worked, but the song was so crap i figured I'd
make it a bit more fun, sat down with Cool Edit open for a while and
jotted down what i "thought" i heard!

<!-- TODO add the song, lol? -->
