It hasn't even been 2 weeks yet, and I have managed to get some new
stuff together for a new spu2ghz release!

This time the most notable changes are the addition of timestretching
and support for winamp DSP plugins.

As a bonus, there's also an option to toggle the speed limiter using
the [Numpad -] key (can be changed in the .ini file).

[You can download it
here.](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=87426&package_id=93611&release_id=605019)

To use winamp DSP pugins I recommend getting [Multiple-DSP
Stacker](http://www.winamp.com/plugins/details/128742) , which will
allow you to easily change DSP plugins and configure them. To enable it
you will have to edit the .ini file and manually point it to the path of
the DSP dll and the module number (normally it's 0, unless it has many
choices in a single dll).

Hope you all like it!
