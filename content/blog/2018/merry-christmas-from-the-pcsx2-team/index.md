Merry Christmas everyone! We know you haven't heard from us for a while
(ok for a long time
ðŸ˜› ) but it was for good reason!

Development has been going strong for several months with some new
members joining and others digging even deeper in PCSX2 issues ironing
them out. People who have been following our
[github](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2) already know how many hacks
have been removed (yes, removed
ðŸ˜› ) lately, with the DX11 renderer of GSdx quickly
catching up to OpenGL accuracy levels thanks to several contributors.
This large boost in progress was incited by gregory helping out the
newcomers with his in-depth knowledge of GSdx, in between his baby's
sleep sessions, so he deserves a big thank you from all of us. The core
has also been improved, while several big PRs are also close to merging,
making this an exciting time for PCSX2!

Thanks to the new (and old) guys giving their time and skills to breathe
some life to PCSX2 and to everyone who still believe in us and
appreciate this project! Have a nice one and keep playing!
