**PCSX2** has been running for over three years now, and it was high
time this project got a new site design! Well here it is! We hope you
like

The site now has a much improved **compatibility** section, which is
continuously updated. Currently it shows what you can expect from the
future 0.9 release. So far only 250 games have been entered, out of the
500 or so we do test! Check back regularly!

**Downloads** have been made clearer, and the site now has a fresh
**screenshots** section, where the *best* shots will be posted. Many
other things have been added, so please browse around and explore!

The site was designed by **CKemu** and coded by **Falcon4ever** . We
would both like to thank the developers, beta testers and our host Bobbi
for their help and support. An apology from myself, for putting up
"..is dead!" - sorry if I scared any of you

The site isn't technically complete yet. Whilst all parts function,
there is much more to do, but both myself and **Falcon4ever** are
pressed for time, so we shall work on it whilst the site is public!
