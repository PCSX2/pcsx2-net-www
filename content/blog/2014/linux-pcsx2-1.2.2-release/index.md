Dear Linux users,

Here is a new release of the greatest PS2 emulator

At version 1.2.2 it is ahead of Windows this time

This new release is based on version 1.2.1 plus two additional patches
regarding GSdx:
1/ It solves depth fighting issues when using NVIDIA drivers
2/ It solves random crashes with AMD drivers

For PPA users, you only need to update your system. For other Linux
packages, ping the maintainer.
