I finally got around updated the configuration guide for the 1.2.1
release with all the new features and also adding some new plugins that
most people don't know about

As usual and you can find instructions on translating it to your language
[here.](http://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-Translator-template-1-2-1)

I have also updated our netplay plugin **DEV9giga-razi** to include the
latest fixes brought by two contributors in Git,
[MrColdbird](https://github.com/MrColdbird) and
[Bigpet](https://github.com/Bigpet) whom we thank for their nice
contributions. The plugin should crash much rarer than it did before, so
we hope it will be usable for those who couldn't run it.

Finally, thanks to a lot of contributions from forum members
(DESTRUIDOR,JBoughter,Altomar and many others), our compatibility list
has been updated and expanded
