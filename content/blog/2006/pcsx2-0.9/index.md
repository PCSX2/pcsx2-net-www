Yes folks **PCSX2 0.9** is here, by no means gracefully, but it is
here!

You can now enjoy **PCSX2 0.9** a faster and more compatible PS2
emulator, it's been a year since *0.8.1* was released so you will see
many dramatic changes!

Many games are now going ingame, and some are even playable (check out
games like Disgaea, or Silent Hill 4!)

On behalf of all the team I would like to say a big **HELLO** to
linuzappz, and a large thank you for everything he's done for us prior
to him leaving the team!

Given the site troubles over the past 24 hours, I can assure you that
myself and several devs right now are totally bald from ripping our hair
out!

Thus the download is being hosted off site, and some aspects of the site
may still be broken, we're working on this, but please give us some
time!

**NOTE: There will be no Linux build for a good few weeks! so apologies
to all linux users!**

**NOTE: PLEASE READ THE HELP FILE BEFORE RUNNING PCSX2!**
