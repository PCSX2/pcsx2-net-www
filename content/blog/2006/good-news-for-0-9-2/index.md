We have recently had **saqib** and **gigaherz** working very hard on
some... parts of pcsx2 and its plugins, the result? it should be rather
enjoyable for you when we release 0.9.2!

I'm not going to tell you what it is, I'm sure you die hard fans will
all guess from this sound clip

**Note:** The sound is a little choppy, but this is due to not running
it at quite full speed, plus background recording of the audio.

A big well done to **saqib** and **gigaherz** !
