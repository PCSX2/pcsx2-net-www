Yes i know this wasn't what people were expecting of an update from the
PCSX2 site,but small news is better than no news
ðŸ˜›
After some bugging by Falcon4ever,i sat down and fixed all 200 errors(
ðŸ˜› ) that were preventing the configuration guide
from being XHTML compatible
ðŸ˜Š You can check the validity by pressing the XHTML
button at the bottom of the page. So if anyone had problems with it with
the browser they were using,there is a good chance that its fixed
now.Note that all the translations have been made using the old html
file so unfortunately they are not XHTML compatible.
Here's the link of the english updated version: [PCSX2 Configuration
Guide](/config-guide/official-english-pcsx2-configuration-guide.html)

Also we have 2 new translations:

Indonesian translation by Exsharaen:
Panduan Pengaturan PCSX2

Italian translation by Master and corrected by Topper:
Guida alla configurazione di PCSX2

Great job and sorry for delaying the release of these 2 for some time
ðŸ˜‰
