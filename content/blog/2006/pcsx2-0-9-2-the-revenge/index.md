**PCSX2 0.9.2 R2** is now available

This fixes an assortment of issues found briefly after 0.9.2's original
launch. It is **strongly** advised that people get this build of 0.9.2
over the initial release.

-   Compatibility regression with **Vampire Night** resolved.
-   **Final Fantasy X** now works for *most* regions.
-   Fixes Crash when using *config>patches*
-   Frame Limiting is now more accurate.
-   Improved zeroGS, **Disgaea 2** menus are now solid.
-   P.E.Op.S SPU2 updated to include threaded mode (useful for video
    recording).
-   Screen Saver / Power Saving now disabled when running PCSX2.


Just to cure our collective headaches "warnings about default.xml"
being blank, or "patches not found", are merely information, they do
**not** in any way effect PCSX2's compatibility or performance.
