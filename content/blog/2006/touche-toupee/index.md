To celebrate the upcoming **PCSX2 0.9.2** release we have recorded a 7
minute 38 second long video of Tekken 4's arcade mode being completed
with Nina!

**PCSX2 0.9.2** will add increased compatibility, improved graphics for
many games, improved MTGS stability and an abundance of features that
you'll get to see in the future.

For now bask in some Tekken 4 action and note the fighting wigs (ahar
now you get the title) are no longer present - as zeroGS has also had
it's fair share of improvements!
