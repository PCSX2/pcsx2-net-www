We're back!! Over the past three weeks you may of noticed that this
site was nothing more than some panties with a BBL sign (didn't
saqib's body look hawt) or a daft reference to PCSX3!

Well the old site was horribly broken and had a variety of flaws, so
myself and the hardworking **Falcon4ever** ripped the site down to give
you this new one! Voila! We hope you like.

A variety of new features and improvements have been impl4mented, I
shall just list a few:

-   Compat list is paginated - reducing load, makes browsing faster to!
-   Compat list is searchable!
-   Greatly reduced load times
-   No framesets - We all hated them, now they're no more!
-   No Popups - No security warnings, flashier to behold, and neater.
-   Clearer navigation, with multi tier menus, plain text navigation for
    easy translation!

One **key** feature is the return of the Donate button
😉

The site has full **Firefox** support, however there are some 'minor'
flaws with IE at present (just making IE6 actually comply was fun
enough!), which will be sorted very soon.

Be sure you check out *Downloads>Videos* for two new videos, and check
there regularly for new footage!

We now also have a working screenshots system on the sites Backend, we
shall be running a mini competition on the forums for everyone to submit
their 'sexiest' screenshot, the best shots will go into the sites
screenshot section, with your name immortalized
😉 More info on that soon.

Finally a massive thanks to the testing team, the devs and poor old
**Falcon4ever**, whom I nagged to death day and night!
