In a previous news post we 'hinted' at work being done by **zerofrog**
with regards to a new *eeREC* (Emotion Engine Recompiler) and *vuREC*
(Vector Unit Recompiler (VU0 and VU1)).

The goal of this complete rewrite is to increase speed, whilst at the
same time improve, or at least maintain current compatibility.

This rewrite has been going on for sometime now, and is starting to
truly show fascinating results, many games now run up to 4x faster, an
example of this would be *Sonic Riders* - previous betas ran at 3.x to
12.x FPS whilst racing, it now runs at 12.x to 35.x FPS

Testing and bug chasing continues, meanwhile a
[thread](http://forums.ngemu.com/pcsx2-official-forum/73799-level-up-erm-speed-up.html)
has been created for testers and developers to demonstrate - in
screenshot form some of these speed increases. Take **careful** note of
the CPU specification given in the post, for instance **Refraction** can
get significantly faster speeds than myself
