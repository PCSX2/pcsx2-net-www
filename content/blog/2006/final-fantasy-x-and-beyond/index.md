**ZeroFrog** has once again been working on PCSX2, and has managed to
fix the once present 'holes' in the terrain models of *Final Fantasy
X* , making the game look excellent. This fix also has a wide range of
effects on other games, so don't worry folks there will be news soon
which doesn't involve a *Final Fantasy* !
ðŸ˜›

Whilst the game certainly now looks beautiful, it's still not playable
from start to finish, due to various 'looping' issues and video
playback, speed is of course an issue with such a complex emulation
task, but will be improved upon in the future, keep watching this
space!

To celebrate this bit of progress, we have a large selection of
screenshots, and one of the sexiest videos I've recorded from PCSX2 in
awhile
