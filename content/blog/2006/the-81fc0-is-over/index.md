**PCSX2 0.9.2** is here!

This release brings several important changes to **PCSX2** , enhancing
compatibility and adding several new aspects to the emulator.

-   ADMA has been added to PCSX2, most (if not all) game videos will
    playback audio, many games now have their music and speech effects.
    Unlike some, we think games need sound.
-   Counter fixes stopping games hitting *long pause* syndrome, or
    crashing.
-   Enhanced MTGS / DC stability, great for those with Dual Core CPUs.
-   IPU improvements, more game videos will now run.
-   VIF fixes, allowing for many games to run or look better.
-   VUrec fixes, improving ingame graphics when under VU recompilation

Also included with this release is the new **Patch Browser** and **Patch
Finder** , the patch browser, allows you to search memory with the tools
and functions you would be used to with a cheat searcher.

The Patch Browser will allow you to enable and disable parts of the
patch during gameplay, e.g. enabling *Infinite Lives* etc!

**HOWEVER!!** - These features are not completed yet, enumerator's and
other features are not present, and the patch browser lacks
functionality! You can still use the patch finder, and an example XML
file with notes is included with this release (in the root dir of
PCSX2), and the new format XML files can be used by PCSX2!

PCSX2 0.9.2 also comes with a new **zeroGS** plugin, which increases
graphical support for several games and fixes some of the bugs found in
the previous version(s).

We're going to save ourselves some hassle next! We're aware many
people want to play **Final Fantasy X** on PCSX2, as you maybe aware the
game is now fully playable, however we would like to make two **very
important** notes:

-   PEOPS CDVD plugin must be used!
-   MTGS can cause some crashes, they are rare, but if the game crashes,
    switch to single core mode for awhile!

Enjoy this release!
