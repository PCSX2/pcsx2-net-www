Since the release of 0.9 the developers have worked hard to improve
PCSX2. Looking at the progress zerofrog is making, the future looks very
promising.

But there is more! **Keith** from the **[emulation64
network](http://www.emulation64.com)** invited one of our developers,
**Refraction** , for a spotlight interview.

***Q :** Could you give us some information regarding the current state
of your projects?
**A :** Well PCSX2 is going well, we have started to focus a bit more on
speed as quite a few games are now working in comparison to older
versions, but we are still bug finding, slowly trying to get in the bits
we have missed and rewriting parts that are completely bugged
