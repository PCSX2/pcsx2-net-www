The coding team and staff of PCSX2 wish you a Happy New Year, filled with happiness, health and new hardware!ðŸ˜›

Due to the holidays and some team members having a life development has
slowed down a bit but work towards the next release is already being
done
ðŸ˜Š We can't promise any dates but let's just say
that the team will do their best to bring you the next 0.9.8 release as
fast as possible (which means the todo list is done, whenever that
is!).

Finally, a big thank you to the people who have donated for the project,
we don't say this often and we should
ðŸ˜Š
