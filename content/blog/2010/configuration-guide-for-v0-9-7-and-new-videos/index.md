I finally got around updating the now (huge) configuration guide for the
new beta version of PCSX2 v0.9.7!
You can read it

As usual, we would love to have as many translations as possible, so if
you are up to it, please apply

We also revamped our video section with 11 new gameplay videos using
0.9.7 courtesy of yours truly, Shadow Lady, Rudy_X and rama.

That's all for now!
