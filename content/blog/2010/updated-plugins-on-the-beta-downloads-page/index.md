Hey people.
While we're still working on the new PCSX2 version, we've also been constantly adding to the all important plugins.
Every now and then we release a beta plugin pack, so you can test them
out and benefit from the new features a bit earlier

SPU2-X 1.4:

-   Yet again improved sound quality by fixing a sample overflow in the
    ADPCM decoder.
-   Adjustable reverb volume, for deeper reverb effects.
-   Fixes to interrupts and status registers that allow many more games
    to boot.
    **Games fixed by this update include titles like Fatal Frame 2 and
    3, Black, the Burnout series, Max Payne 2, Silent Hill 0rigins,
    Silent Hill Shattered Memories and, of course, "Disney Princess:
    Enchanted Journey"**
