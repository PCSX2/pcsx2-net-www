It's been some time since the last news post so this will help bring everyone up to date with what we've been up to.

- For those of you who haven't heard, the latest SVN builds of PCSX2
have a new speed hack thanks to cottonvibes, named MTVU (multi threaded
VU) which enables PCSX2 to use 3 threads now! (4 if you count the minor
GUI thread). The speed hack has very high compatibility and provides a
big speed boost in most games, especially for triple and quad core CPUs
(but even on dual cores).

- We have a new page on our site, which you can view by clicking 'SVN'
at the top menu. You will find the 20 latest SVN builds there, courtesy
of Orphis' build bot so you will be always up to date with the bleeding
edge changes in PCSX2! Do keep in mind that these builds might be a bit
buggier than the official releases since they are all work in progress.

- The configuration
guide has been updated for the 0.9.8 release (a bit late
ðŸ˜›) and a new [quick start
guide](http://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-Quick-Start-PCSX2-Configuration-Guide-v0-9-8)
has been created by avih aiming to be much more compact and easy to
read. As always you can apply for translating in [this
thread](http://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-Program-and-Guide-translation-applications)
. Check them both out!

- A new input plugin named Nuvee and developed by Shalma came to our
attention, which is the first to support Lightguns and USB Mice! It
seems it already works with almost all games supporting Lightguns so be
sure to check it out
[HERE](http://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-Nuvee-PS1-PS2-input-plugin-supporting-lightguns-by-Shalma).

- New PCSX2 wiki hosted on our server, you can find it
[here!](http://wiki.pcsx2.net) . With your input, the wiki will
eventually become a huge knowledge base for individual game settings and
known workarounds for bugs, so those of you willing, start contributing
your findings

- Our youtube channel already has over 150,000 video views and almost
2,000 subscribers!

That's all for now
