Work on 0.9.7 is in progress and with very promising results some of the changes are making it into the 0.9.6 build which is probably going to be the last for this version.

The main improvement is proper implementation of memory protection
handling for pcsx2, which should give 25-50% performance boost depending
on the game.

This build is only for Snow Leopard 10.6.3 or newer and includes updated
ZZOgl 0.21.213 and zerospu2 installed by default.
