After [my earlier news post](/246-merry-xmas-2012.html) about some
incredible tools our community members have developed for PCSX2, it's
time people learn more about them
😊

All the tool authors graciously gave us their permission to add their
various programs to our download system, so you can easily review them
and have them more accessible. You will find all kinds of tools, from
some great **frontends for PCSX2** which so many people ask for, to very
powerful **save editors** and **cheat generators** to Scarlet Crush's
renowned **Xinput wrapper for DS3 controllers** !


Thanks to all the authors of these programs, which are all provided for
free just like PCSX2! We'll try to keep everything updated to their
latest versions for your convenience.

P.S. If any tool author has any issues with the description or finds any
incorrect information, please contact me to fix it.
