In our spare time, some of us do little things to amuse ourselves and
others, generally involving the betatesters, the devs, or generally
people who come in the IRC channel.

You may have previously seen CKemu's "Betatester Magazine" issues or his
comic strips involving testers and developers. Well my "party piece" is
making little songs, with the help of some of our IRC chatters of
course!

Bositman is well known throughout the community, so we (being myself and
GB\_Away) decided a while ago to make a little song in his honor, it was
catchy and fun to make but i wasn't totally happy with the sound.
Recently i decided to remaster the song and redo the guitar, so for your
listening pleasure i have placed it online for all to be amused!

The lyrics are simple but they say enough!

"Bositman, Bositman, ooooooooooooo, Bositman, Bositman, Bositman,
Bositman, BOSITMAN!, Bositman, oooooooooooooooo, Bositman, Bositman,
Bositman, Bositman"

<!-- TODO - add the song? lol -->
<!-- And here in nice 320kbps 48khz MP3 format, is the song, enjoy!

Edit by bositman: Dude,I told you it's not pronounced as an "s" but
"z"!!
