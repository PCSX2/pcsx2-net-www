**Florin** has just released **BIOS Dumper v2.0**

This program will dump the PS2 BIOS, DVD Player ROM, NVM etc from your
PlayStation 2 via a 'host' enabled connection.

PCSX2 0.9.4 will be using the new format BIOS (*.p2b) created by **BIOS
Dumper v2.0** , as it dumps a more "complete" copy of the BIOS. It is
**highly** recommended that you redump your BIOS to get a more complete
dump and thus enable PCSX2 to more accurately emulate the PlayStation 2

You won't need to throw away your old BIOS files, as a convertor will
be released in the future to convert the older format to **P2B** .
Conversion is no substitute for a redump as converted BIOS's will
**not** contain the new information dumped from **BIOS Dumper v2.0** .

**EDIT** : If you have downloaded **before** 30d 6m 2007y @ 20:11 GMT+0,
or are having problems making the p2b file, please redownload the files
provided, as they have been updated!
