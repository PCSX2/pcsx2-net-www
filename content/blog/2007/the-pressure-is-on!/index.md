Just a quick note to let you guys know i have just uploaded a modified
version of **SSSPSX Pad 1.7** to change how its pressure sensitive
buttons work. If you play games such as **Final Fantasy XII** and **Gran
Turismo 3** , you will know on the current release you have to press
X+R2 O+L1 etc, well not anymore😊

You can find this release in the Download section.

Big thanks goes out to Nagisa for this excellent plugin and i hope you
will consider using this pressure style in future releases instead of
the 2-Button combos😉

Enjoy
