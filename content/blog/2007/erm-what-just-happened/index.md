Testing can be a comical affair!

For instance **Katamari Damacy** , the poor little pint sized prince
kept on falling through the universe, even better is the King would keep
apologizing for a *Royal Warp* and return the prince to a new location,
only for it to happen again.

**Metal Gear Solid 3** suffers(ed) from a similar problem, Snake would
suddenly drop though an invisible hole, causing the classic "Snake, are
you alright? snake? SNAKE!!!"

**Final Fantasy X** still suffers from characters getting placed the
wrong way around, so they run away from the monster, smite it and
somehow return to the same position. **WipeOut Fusion** also suffers
from things going backwards, every ship gets placed the wrong way
around, and the AI along with you have to turn around before they can
race!

**Tekken Tag** has *Squishy Head Syndrome* , you kick a character in the
face and your head goes perfectly flat, suddenly "anything but the
face!!" takes on an entire new meaning!

Over the course of testing for PCSX2 the team has encountered thousands
upon thousands of bugs, but despite popular belief that all bugs are
graphical, many of these bugs are much more bizarre. In fact the PCSX2
project may have released many a fine video demonstrating progress, we
could have released an epic film trilogy of *bloopers* by now.

Now admittedly finding a bug requires the tester to try hundreds of
program combinations (plugins, recompilers settings, debug options etc),
make long debug logs and attempt to find the bug in the debugger or
trace the origin of the bug if it's a regression, but sometimes just
watching the bug makes it all worthwhile!

I fondly remember the *linuz.naked\_bug();* , where characters in
**Street Fighter EX3** would be missing clothes - specifically the women
missing skirts. Or how about every character in **Final Fantasy X**
being Tidus, yes folks **EVERY** character, from enemies, to people
walking around, nothing like hearing the pretty girl-boy with Yuna's
voice!

Sometimes It's tempting to suggest we add an option to the emulator to
"re-create" these bugs, from totally missing collision detection, AI
going berserk, to people floating upside down, but alas we're here to
emulate the PS2, not our goofs.

So next time you think of emulation bugs, do not assume they're always
graphical, or some complex mind boggling bug that causes the game to do
nothing - sometimes, just sometimes there's a poor unshaven tester in a
darkened room, covered in coffee that they've just spat out because Lara
Crofts boobs have just exploded, or Gran Turismo cars have just
developed anti gravity drives!

So as a rare treat, and somewhat a prelude to current **Work in
Progress** , here's a game with some of it's bugs intact!

**Katamari Damacy** - Status at time of writing: <span

List of testing **notes** :

-   Floor Bug, seems the textures they use to do floor detail are
    layered? (zBuffer)
-   Object clipping bugs (walls etc).
-   Katamari Mask? (the circle around the katamari, perhaps used to cull
    objects under the outer layer of what you have collected?).
-   Stuck on pillar, can't go anywhere bug! (Level 3).
