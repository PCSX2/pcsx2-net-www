*Refraction, what have you done? You've changed history. You've
created a Time Paradox!*

**Real Time Clock** (RTC) has been recently implemented by *Refraction*
. PCSX2 now takes the current system time from your OS and inserts the
value into PCSX2 upon launch, from that point onwards the emulated RTC
counts independently from the OS.

So? you wonder, well apart from the BIOS now displaying the correct time
and date - you would think this is a minor addition to PCSX2, nothing
more than an addition to authenticity? Well you're in for a surprise!

It struck me when talking to *Refraction* over a cup of coffee, **Metal
Gear Solid 3** uses system time for various *fun* aspects of the game -
Such as being able to kill *The End* from old age if you set the RTC 1
year ahead after saving during the battle.

**Metal Gear Solid 3** had never done anything under PCSX2, so with the
RTC addition to PCSX2 in mind, I popped the disc into my drive, and
eureka it booted!! This however was only the beginning of an epic saga
between *Zerofrog* and the *Konami programmers* !

*Zerofrog* has spent days wrestling with *Konami's* ability to push the
PS2 hardware to its limits by making **zeroGS KOSMOS** push the limits
of GPU's, *Metal Gear Solid 3* certainly loves its post processing! Not
only has he managed to get the game looking ..well from absolute garbage
to gorgeous, he's also managed to stop *Snake* from slipping through
holes in the universe instantly.

The game still has issues, *Snake* still manages to find holes in the
universe (falls through geometry), and he still likes to get stuck
inside trees, rocks or just teleport off the edge of the world (the
video demonstrates the latter beautifully!). The game also still suffers
from visual issues, such as missing textures and the specular lighting
overlay being drawn wrong, hopefully by the time the next incarnation of
PCSX2 comes out, these issues will be **mostly** resolved.

So to celebrate this game going from nothing to ingame and the
challenges it threw at us, we're releasing a video and **63** shots!
Not all 63 are here though, General Emulation run by our betatester
**General Plot** has 31 exclusive shots, so head there for the rest!

All this maybe great news (especially for MGS fans), but there is more,
you may have noticed the nothing status games have been decreasing
steadily and the playable count is going up on our [on site
compatibility list](/compatibility-list.html) , including some rather
nice games...and there is a new plugin coming up...but you'll have to
wait!
ðŸ˜‰

Now enjoy the video which you can grab from here (it's a torrent so
please seed, and check out our other torrented videos here)
