Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year everyone! We hope 2020 brings you
and your loved ones everything you wish for, including a PCSX2 stable
release!
ðŸ˜›

On that front, there has been lots of work lately on finalizing the
remaining Pull Requests and resolving all issues labeled for the stable
1.6 release. We are on a feature freeze so most of our efforts are
concentrated on polishing, bug fixing and documentation. As usual, we
are fashionably late but we hope the end product will be worth the wait!

I wanted to take this opportunity to say goodbye to our years long
tester and contributor General Plot, we've had some really good times
and laughs over the years messing around with PCSX2 and breaking stuff!
He doesn't have time to dedicate to PCSX2 anymore due to the good old
real life (TM), but he will still keep an eye on us
ðŸ˜Š

Till next time, which will probably be release time, have a great 2020!
