For a myriad of reasons, we've migrated to a new website.  It should be much easier to maintain and edit -- so hopefully this translates into more interesting articles, quicker progress-reports and eventually a more streamlined experience for finding game compatibility issues.

Old blog posts and articles will slowly be moved over to this site with the old URL formats being preserved.  This means that in the long-term, there should be no dead links.

No migration is complete without some small hiccups though, and there will likely be some rough edges that need to be smoothed out, so bear with us!
