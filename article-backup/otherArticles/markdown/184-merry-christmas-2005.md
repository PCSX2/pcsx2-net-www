No release for Christmas, but one coming sometime in **January** - we
hope, assuming shadow, saqib and refraction don't get lost, drunk or
kidnapped by kinky Japanese Female Ninjas (they wish that would happen

So instead of a release as a Christmas present, how about some hot
**xxx** action starring our loyal betatester *Bositman* instead ![Evil
