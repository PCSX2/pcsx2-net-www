**PCSX2 0.9.1** is now available to download
[here](/download/viewcategory/29-pcsx2-v0-9-1.html) , enjoy!

This release brings a *significant* speed increase to the majority of
games, this is due to a complete rewrite of the EE and VU recompilers.
Various other improvements have increased compatibility with games, you
will be able to check your game against the included compatibility list,
which lists nearly **1000** titles (Please note at time of release list
is not guaranteed 100% accurate).

Whilst the new recompilers are a major improvement, the recompilers are
not 100% accurate at present, this *may* result in a number of broken
games.

A further release will be created in the future enhancing upon the
overall compatibility of the new recompilers. This is part of a new
release schedule where we plan to be releasing more frequently; however,
do not make requests for releases or ask when such a release will be
produced.

As ever we have opened a 'screenshots' thread for you to post in, and
the forums are there for you to discuss the project and ask questions.

You will also be aware that the **Hot Shots Contest** started earlier
this month. Given the lack of entries so far, we are extending the
contest deadline until the **15th July 2006** , you may enter shots from
PCSX2 0.9.1 (recommended) or 0.9, those of you who have already entered
are allowed to update your posts with new submissions if you wish.

Hopefully people are more imaginative, and post less *Final Fantasy*
shots
ðŸ˜‰

**EDIT:** A regression bug was fixed. Now Makai Kingdom, Grandia II,
Rez, and Taito Legends should work. It is recommended that you
redownload 0.9.1.
