**General Plot** has been strangely happy these past few days, *slowly*
taking screenshots and recording a video from **Grandia 3** , beta

So yes you guessed it, there\'s a video with this news post, but you
have to admit, seeing something in motion truly gives a better
impression of what it looks like!\
\
Video is **AVI** using xVid so you will need a media player capable of
playing back this format. This file is being shared using **Bit
Torrent** , so you will need a torrent client, such as
[uTorrent](http://www.utorrent.com/) to download this video.\

Grandia 3 Ingame\
1 Minutes 13 Seconds \| 13.8 MB \| Real Ingame Speed - 1.5-2 FPS.\

Along with this video, there is a selection of screenshots posted on the
