With **100,000** unique visitors having visited this site in it's short
time online (13 days), both myself and *Falcon4ever* are happy it's
gone so smoothly.

So a video of *Makai Kingdom* in action has been recorded for you lot to
download and enjoy, including audio (speech, music, sound effects).

So you are thinking **woopiee** a video, wow, that's shocking...

width="20" height="20"} , well hold that thought, what if I told you
that the video only had to be sped up by about 10 FPS to get to 60 FPS,
e.g. what you see is practically what it's emulated at!

What?!! near full speed emulation?!! impossible I hear you cry, well I
did tell you that **zerofrog** was re-writing the eeREC and vuREC
ðŸ˜‰ There's a lot to do, as in all honesty *many*
games got broken with bugs during the transition from the old rec, to
the new, but he's still not blinking, and he is avoiding sleep, so
hopefully more news eventually!

Enough of that for now, enjoy the video, which you can grab on
[this](/demo-videos-screenshots/videos.html) page (click the
'DOWNLOAD' image to the right of the details
ðŸ˜‰ ).
