With **100,000** unique visitors having visited this site in it\'s short
time online (13 days), both myself and *Falcon4ever* are happy it\'s
gone so smoothly.\
\
So a video of *Makai Kingdom* in action has been recorded for you lot to
download and enjoy, including audio (speech, music, sound effects).\
\
So you are thinking **woopiee** a video, wow, that\'s shocking\...

width="20" height="20"} , well hold that thought, what if I told you
that the video only had to be sped up by about 10 FPS to get to 60 FPS,
e.g. what you see is practically what it\'s emulated at!\
\
What?!! near full speed emulation?!! impossible I hear you cry, well I
did tell you that **zerofrog** was re-writing the eeREC and vuREC
😉 There\'s a lot to do, as in all honesty *many*
games got broken with bugs during the transition from the old rec, to
the new, but he\'s still not blinking, and he is avoiding sleep, so
hopefully more news eventually!\
\
Enough of that for now, enjoy the video, which you can grab on
[this](/demo-videos-screenshots/videos.html) page (click the
\'DOWNLOAD\' image to the right of the details
😉 ).
