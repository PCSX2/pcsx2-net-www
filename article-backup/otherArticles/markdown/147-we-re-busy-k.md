*Busy* is certainly one way to describe PCSX2 development currently!

Progress on **PCSX2 0.9.4** is coming along nicely with several members
of the team making some significant additions to the project!

**Zerofrog** has fixed the SPS (Spikey Polygon Syndrome) that plagued
*Kingdom Hearts 2* , making the game much more viewable and **almost**
playable!

To demonstrate this, below are 10 **High Quality** shots from various
areas of the game, but take special note when viewing the
images...why?

ZeroGS development has also continued during this hectic time, and those
of you with great GPU's can enjoy 8x and 16x render target (referred to
as AA within the plugin).

Also head on over to our [videos](/demo-videos-screenshots/videos.html)
section to get a video of *Kingdom Hearts 2* being played! Video is
provided as a torrent so **please** seed!

**Saqib** has recently been working hard on memory card issues, testing
is still under way however thanks to his work games like *Phantasy Star
Universe* are now getting ingame and the ever popular *Resident Evil 4*
can now load saves, and if all goes to plan - save to!

**Refraction** is also busy and after his success with **Path 3** work
has turned his attention to other issues, thanks to his work *Tekken 5*
is now getting ingame! Currently *Tekken 5* can't be classed as
playable as characters are totally lacking in the Y dimension!

Plenty more where all this came from...watch this space!
