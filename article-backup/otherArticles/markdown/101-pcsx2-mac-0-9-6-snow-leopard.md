## [PCSX2-Mac - 0.9.6 Snow Leopard](/101-pcsx2-mac-0-9-6-snow-leopard.html) {#pcsx2-mac---0.9.6-snow-leopard .contentheading}

Work on 0.9.7 is in progress and with very promising results some of the
changes are making it into the 0.9.6 build which is probably going to be
the last for this version. You can download it
[here](/download/releases/mac/viewcategory/5-mac.html) . The downloads
repository for pcsx2-mac is always located at
[pcsx2mac.net](http://pcsx2mac.net/downloads)


The main improvement is proper implementation of memory protection
handling for pcsx2, which should give 25-50% performance boost depending
on the game.

This build is only for Snow Leopard 10.6.3 or newer and includes updated
ZZOgl 0.21.213 and zerospu2 installed by default.

The ZZOgl-pg r3536 has also been added to plugin repository
[here](http://pcsx2mac.net/downloads/)
