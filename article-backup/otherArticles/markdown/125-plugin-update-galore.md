It's summer vacations for most of us and as you've seen PCSX2
development has been pretty slow these days!

But,some great plugins for PCSX2 have recently got updated and are worth
mentioning:

Gsdx 0.1.9: Gabest releases yet another version of his fast DX9 / DX10
GS plugin improving speed and compatibility.You can get it from our
downloads page

Lilypad 0.9.4: Chickenliver keeps updating this pad plugin with constant
bug fixes and features,so be sure to check it out.Also in our downloads

Gigaherz's cdvd plugin v0.7 WIP 3: A new CDVD plugin by Gigaherz which
is in very early stages but making progress.You can download it and give
it a try in this thread
[here](http://forums.pcsx2.net/thread-2354.html)

Edit: New DEV9 (HDD) plugin by NHerve released! It is also in early
stages (first release) but it's a big breakthrough since it is the
first working DEV9 plugin! You can check it out here:
[MegaDev9](http://forums.ngemu.com/ps2-plugin-questions-troubleshooting/109713-megadev9-plugin.html)

That's it for now,I'll try to keep updating the download section with
the new releases.
Enjoy your summer vacations people
