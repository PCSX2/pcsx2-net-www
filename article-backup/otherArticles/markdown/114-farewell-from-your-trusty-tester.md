## [Farewell from your trusty tester.](/114-farewell-from-your-trusty-tester.html) {#farewell-from-your-trusty-tester. .contentheading}

All things must come to an end. And despite my sincerest hopes, my
participation in this project is no different. It's with a heavy heart,
and with a feeling that some may consider a lack of love (which I assure
all of you it is not), that I make the decision today to leave PCSX2
entirely and officially. There is no point in dragging out what must be
done. My life demands far more from me than I will ever be able to
dedicate to such a task as this, and while I hate to have to choose,
when it comes down to it, I really have no choice. I can choose to live
in solitude and continue on as always, or I can make a move forward in
life and let go of one final link in the chain that has been holding me
back. My love for this project and those involved in it for over 6 years
now, and many I have come to know as people make this decision extremely
difficult. I hate to walk away from something I love so much, and to see
a true dream like seeing the PS2 virtualized and so close to our goal
makes doing this even harder, but I have made up my mind. I need to move
forward, and so I leave the legacy that is PCSX2 as part of my history.
Being involved in a project so high profile is something I will always
remember. Thanks to all those that have given me support throughout
these years and to those that still believe in the same things I did
over half a decade ago. Never give up on the dream to keep the reality
alive: the PCSX2 team is accomplishing what Sony couldn't. Always
remember the hard work that goes into such a project as this. As always,
I will keep General Emulation going. Take care to all those I've met
and those I haven't. I love all of you.

Thanks for the memories. - General Plot
