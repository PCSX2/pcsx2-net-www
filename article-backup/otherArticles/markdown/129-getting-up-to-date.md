Hey everyone,this isn\'t anything exciting but I just wanted to let you
know.\
Our download section has finally been brought up to date with all the
updated versions of the GS and Pad plugins which are under development.\
Also,some outdated and useless files have been removed to prevent
confusion.\
I\'ve also updated our sourceforge page (
[http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcsx2/)](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcsx2/)
with the current info (it was last updated about 3 years ago!),added
some screenshots and both FAQ - readme docs in the documentation
section.\
\
In other (more interesting for you) news,development is going good as
you\'re able to see from the frequent SVN updates,with Refraction making
the usual core changes,with a recent one giving a huge speed boost in
some games (albeit breaking some,still trying to figure out what to do
with that).\
Saqib is also working on something behind the scenes,wait and see when
it\'s done
