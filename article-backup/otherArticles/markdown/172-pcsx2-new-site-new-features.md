We\'re back!! Over the past three weeks you may of noticed that this
site was nothing more than some panties with a BBL sign (didn\'t
saqib\'s body look hawt ![Very
Happy](https://pcsx2.net/images/stories/frontend/smilies/biggrin.gif){.yvSmiley
width="20" height="20"} ) or a daft reference to PCSX3!\
\
Well the old site was horribly broken and had a variety of flaws, so
myself and the hardworking **Falcon4ever** ripped the site down to give
you this new one! Voila! We hope you like.\
\
A variety of new features and improvements have been impl4mented, I
shall just list a few:

-   Compat list is paginated - reducing load, makes browsing faster to!
-   Compat list is searchable!
-   Greatly reduced load times
-   No framesets - We all hated them, now they\'re no more!
-   No Popups - No security warnings, flashier to behold, and neater.
-   Clearer navigation, with multi tier menus, plain text navigation for
    easy translation!

One **key** feature is the return of the Donate button

\
The site has full **Firefox** support, however there are some \'minor\'
flaws with IE at present (just making IE6 actually comply was fun
enough!), which will be sorted very soon.\
\
Be sure you check out *Downloads\>Videos* for two new videos, and check
there regularly for new footage!\
\
We now also have a working screenshots system on the sites Backend, we
shall be running a mini competition on the forums for everyone to submit
their \'sexiest\' screenshot, the best shots will go into the sites
screenshot section, with your name immortalized

\
Finally a massive thanks to the testing team, the devs and poor old
**Falcon4ever** , whom I nagged to death day and night!
