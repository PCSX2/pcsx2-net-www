Sorry about the long silence folks. I know most of you must be wondering
what's going on these days and wondering where has everyone gone. Some
of you already know I've been busy with moving from the US to the UK
and this has kept me quite busy with sorting out visas and then with the
actual move. Of course, once I made it, I was far from being able to put
much time aside to be active again. I had a marriage to prepare for!

Well, I'm happy to say that I am now married to a certain lady some of
you may know as Raefraction. She is the sister of refraction, and so
this now makes me his brother in law. Odd as it may seem, PCSX2 became a
gateway to something more than I could have ever imagined. It's led me
to my beautiful wife and great new family. I'm not sure if this is a
first for emulation, but I'm sure anyone would be hard pressed to find
another example quite like this.
ðŸ˜›

All that said, I'm working my way towards getting back into the swing
of things. I've still got just a few more quirks to work out, but the
bulk of it is done. I'm also planning on egging on my new brother in
law to get back into this with me as well. Give us just a bit more time,
and I'll see what I can do. Thanks for bearing with us while things
have been busy in our every day lives.

For those interested, you can see pictures from the wedding (which
include myself, refraction, Raefraction and family) at General
Emulation.

Also there is a video I've uploaded to youtube of the ceremony. Keep in
mind that due to their 10 minute limits for videos, I've had to
separate it into two parts, which you can view in the above post as
well. Thanks again, and I'll be back soon.
