Hey everyone,long time since I've posted some news on the PCSX2 site.
For those who haven't noticed,the PCSX2 Configuration Guide has been
updated for v0.9.2 and is now integrated in this site itself! You can
view it simply by clicking on the "Guide" link at the main menu.

With the help of my buddy Falcon4ever, the guide has been converted to
mybb code and we now have a new system for translations! The translators
will be send a txt file which no longer has any code inside, making it
easier for them as to what needs translating.

If anyone wants to apply for a translation, they must first drop me a
mail at this address [ This email address is being protected from
spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.

. If there is no other translator working on the same language,I will
send back a mail with the txt to be translated.You can also check on the
updated WIP list on emuforums
[here](http://forums.ngemu.com/pcsx2-official-forum/58506-pcsx2-configuration-guide.html)
. Note that translators are chosen at a first come basis!

I already have people translating for
Greek,German,Italian,Dutch,Spanish,Russian,Serbian,Brazilian
Portuguese,French,Polish,Swedish and Turkish so no need to apply for
these languages.

The translated guides will be uploaded as soon as possible, after I
receive them and check for errors and cases of babelfish.You will be
able to select them by pressing the respective flag buttons on the guide
page, after they are done

Thats all from me, I'll get back to the usual beta testing slavery
