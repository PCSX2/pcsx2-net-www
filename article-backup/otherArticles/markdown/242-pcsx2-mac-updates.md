The developer of the Mac port of PCSX2,
[zedr0n](http://forums.pcsx2.net/User-zedr0n) , came back with a bang
after some time of silence! He has released a new version of his 0.9.6
port of PCSX2 for Lion with some additional compatibility fixes. Here is
what he had to say about it:

> [ I ]{.open} m releasing a slightly updated version of pcsx2 0.9.6 it
> should crash less because of the audio plugin. 0.9.7 is proving very
> difficult so no update for now.
> 
> From this version onwards this becomes a regular .dmg bundle with
> pcsx2.app separated from the required libraries package which is still
> included in the dmg by default.
> You can get it from Downloads or direct link pcsx2.dmg
> 
> The package has been cleaned so that all libraries reside in
> /usr/local/pcsx2 and can be removed easily. The Uninstaller.pkg
> included in the dmg will do that for you.
> 
> Latest version of XQuartz and CG framework still require [ d ]{.close}

In addition, he released an early 0.9.7 alpha port. This version should
be considered unstable and pre-beta but you can give it a try. Here is
what was posted about this:

> [ A ]{.open} nd the day has come Im releasing a very early alpha
> version of 0.9.7 it does play some games but you are advised to do a
> lot of save states.
> 
> Im going to continue working on this so hopefully will get better as
> the time goes on.
> 
> You can grab it here: pcsx2 0.9.7.dmg
> 
> The installer includes another mandatory package WXWidgets.pkg which
> should be installed after Libraries.pkg. Note that Uninstaller.pkg is
> going to delete the whole install but otherwise 0.9.6 and 0.9.7
> coexist well [ . ]{.close}

You can download both files from our [Mac Downloads
