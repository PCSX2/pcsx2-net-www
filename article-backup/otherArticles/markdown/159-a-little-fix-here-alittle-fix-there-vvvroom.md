**Refraction** has been 'abit' busy!
ðŸ˜› He's been 'in the zone' for the past few
nights fixing **VIF Unpacks** , which decompress then send texture and
vector data to the VUs.

Such fixes have a wide impact on games, some *initial* results below:
Clocktower 3 - SPS (Spikey Polygon Syndrome) fixed!
Grandia III - Random crash fixed!
Sega Rally 2006 - SPS fixed!
Super Monkey Ball - Graphics looking 'significantly' improved!
X-Men Legends - Graphics completely fixed!

Oh and for racing fans, there is one other game showing significant
progress ![Very
