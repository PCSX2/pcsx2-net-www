Work towards **PCSX2 0.9.4** continues at a steady pace! **GiGaHeRz**
has done significant work towards USB emulation, and we now have
**keyboard support!**\
\
When going online with PCSX2, or even a real PS2, chat and general team
work requires you type to other players, thus **GiGaHeRz** was inspired
to work on the USB side of PS2 emulation and bring us working keyboard
support!\
\
You don\'t even need a USB keyboard plugged into your PC, it can be any
type of keyboard

more **Monster Hunter** together\...\*ahem\*\
\
You may be wondering why the first word in the news post is just a bunch
of stars? Well it seems *Capcom* like any sensible network game
developer, censor certain words, however whilst \'testing\' PCSX2 we
soon found that the word **after** is censored in the game, whats even
funnier, the word *wanker* isn\'t! (gasp, swearing on news page!)\
\
Video and yet more shots of our exploits, the video certainly makes me
chuckle ![Evil or Very
