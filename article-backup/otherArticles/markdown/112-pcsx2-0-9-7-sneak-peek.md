## [PCSX2 0.9.7 sneak peek!](/112-pcsx2-0-9-7-sneak-peek.html) {#pcsx2-0.9.7-sneak-peek .contentheading}

It has been a long time since the last news concerning PCSX2, so I
thought I\'d bring you up to date

Development of the new 0.9.7 version of the emulator with the all new
GUI is going strong and soon all the old GUI functionality will be
implemented. After that it\'s bug hunting time and then a beta release!\
\
In this news post I\'ll present some of the exciting new features of the
new GUI builds, for those of you who haven\'t checked it out yet!\

    handling

-   Console output will no longer slow down the emulator when flooded
    thanks to threading

    flinch when you save

That\'s it! Hope you like the new look and functionality, we are doing
our best to make PCSX2 as user friendly as possible. Of course there are
still some features not shown here, we have to keep something to
surprise you!\
\
There is no set date for the beta release, since there are still a bunch
of bugs lying around but it\'s safe to say we are getting close

You can compile it yourselves, from our [GoogleCode
SVN](http://code.google.com/p/pcsx2/source/checkout) but **no support
will be given for it at the forums!** .
