## [SPU2-X 1.5!](/82-spu2-x-1-5.html) {#spu2-x-1.5 .contentheading}

Hey guys,\
In light of recent fixes and additions we prepared a new SPU2-X release
for you
☺️

\
This one focuses on SPU2 emulation accuracy but there\'s also the much
requested volume adjustment feature included.\
You can now try a fake SPU2 reverb mode that may sound better than the
(still somewhat broken) original reverb.\
\
Emulation improvements:\
- Reverb engine reviewed and mostly rewritten.\
- Initialization modified to reflect test results, including a critical
portion of the BIOS initialization sequence to support fast boot.\
- Hardware reset feature removed because tests failed to prove its
existence.\
- Possible null pointer access eliminated.\
- Added support for reading KON and KOF registers, which is used in the
BIOS.\
- Improved voice loop logic based on tests.\
- Constantly mix the input area and generate IRQs from accessing it.\
\
Among the fixed games are titles such as:\
- F1 2005\
- Burnout in-game music\
- Tomb Raider (the whole series)\
- Spyro the Dragon\
- Gauntlet Dark Legacy\
- Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver 2\
- etc\
\
Hope you enjoy, and please report all (new) bugs if you find them!
