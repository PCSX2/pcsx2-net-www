Gabest popped on to the forums yesterday to release a new version of his
plugin, notable changes being:
*This version fixes a few things like shaking/interlacing
MTGS crash fix
Software rendering reaching about 10-20% higher framerate*

Do note this version requires Pixel Shader 2 and SSE2. Unfortunately the
Pixel Shader thing can no longer be helped due to microsoft removing
Pixelshader 1.1 and 1.4 support from DirectX, so for those without, this
is an omen to update your graphics card
