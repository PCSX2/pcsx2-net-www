On December 25th (I know... great timing >_> ), we will be switching
our website to a new server. This means that the frontpage and the
forums will be down for quite a while. The server will be taken offline
around noon CET.


Scheduled tasks:
- Site backup (This could take a couple of hours)
- Transfer data (less than one hour)
- Restore the forums (less than one hour)
- Restore the frontend (less than one hour)

If no problems occur, the server should be back online at the end of the
day (CET).

Merry Christmas!
- Falc.
