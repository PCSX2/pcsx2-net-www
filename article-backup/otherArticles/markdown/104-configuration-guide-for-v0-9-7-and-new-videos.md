## [Configuration guide for v0.9.7 and new videos](/104-configuration-guide-for-v0-9-7-and-new-videos.html) {#configuration-guide-for-v0.9.7-and-new-videos .contentheading}

I finally got around updating the now (huge) configuration guide for the
new beta version of PCSX2 v0.9.7!
You can read it
[here.](http://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-Official-English-PCSX2-configuration-guide-v0-9-7)

As usual, we would love to have as many translations as possible, so if
you are up to it, please apply
[here](http://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-Guide-translation-applications) .

We also revamped our video section with 11 new gameplay videos using
0.9.7 courtesy of yours truly, Shadow Lady, Rudy_X and rama. The
downloads are available via torrents (click the download button on the
right) which you can grab from our videos section
[here](/demo-videos-screenshots/videos.html) . As usual please help us
seed as much as possible!
We will also consider accepting user created videos to host them on our
torrent tracker in the future
ðŸ˜Š

That's all for now!
