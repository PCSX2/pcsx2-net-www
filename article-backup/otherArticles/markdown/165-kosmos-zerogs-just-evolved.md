\...Yes you read that correctly, and no it\'s not April 1st!\
\
**WAIT** !!..Okay so you knew there would be a catch

\
**MTGS** (Multi Threaded GS) has recently become much more stable thanks
to *zerofrog* and his recent improvements to **ZeroGS** (a GS plugin for
PCSX2). MTGS allows for people with **Dual Core** CPU\'s to run PCSX2 at
significantly improved speeds by putting the graphics side of PCSX2 onto
a separate core.\
\
ZeroGS itself has also gone through a **major** overhaul, making it
significantly faster, even without the use of MTGS, so the Single Core
crowd will also see a speed boost via this plugin!\
\
ZeroGS offers more features in the up coming release, with improved AA,
wireframe mode, video recording, bilinear filtering and pre-defined
resolutions to choose from.\
\
So whats the catch? Well ZeroGS requires **Pixel Shader 2.0** , so you
*need* a graphics card capable of this shader model (I recommend the
GeForce 6600GT for budget users).\
\
The other catch is somewhat obvious, you will need a Dual Core CPU to
support MTGS mode, eg; AMD X2\'s, Opterons and of course the new
Conroe.\
\
So when does this new ZeroGS come out? Well for now no ETA, and please
don\'t be nagging us about it! ![Rolling

Enough of the text, lets move onto my favorite section - eyecandy!\
\
The shots where taken on the following spec machine:

-   Opteron 165 1.8Ghz @ 2.5Ghz (9x280)
-   1Gb DDR550 Dual Channel @ DDR560
-   Gainward BLISS 7900 GTX 512Mb
-   SoundBlaster Audigy 4

Note FPS is **reduced** by \~50% in these shots because they where taken
with Bilinear Filtering, and 4xAA enabled:\

Oh, and check out the new [**blog**](/developer-blog.html) section!
