Okay, they aren't new, they have been on NGemu a while, but they have
been getting some good support from the community and i felt they needed
adding to the official site!!

Due to the hard work of **Rebel_X** and **ChickenLiver** from the PCSX2
forums, we are proud to present **LilyPad** and **TwinPad** plugins,
which both allow keyboard users to have full use of the analog sticks!
I'm sure you will enjoy them as much as the forum users have.

Head over to the [Plugin
Download](/download/viewcategory/9-plugins.html) section to get them
now!
