## [Scheduled downtime](/103-scheduled-downtime-2010.html) {#scheduled-downtime .contentheading}

Tomorrow (12/11/2010) we will move the site to another server.
The current server will be taken down in the morning (CET). This means
that the portal and forums will be offline.

If no problems occur, the site should be back online at the end of the
day (CET). Because we are switching servers, we will also need to update
the DNS entries. It might take some time before these resolve
correctly.

- Falc.

EDIT: 02:00 PM / CET
We should be back online, in case your DNS server has not been updated
yet you can add the following entries to your hosts file:
77.68.38.14 pcsx2.net
77.68.38.14 forums.pcsx2.net
