It seems like our developers are on steroids, there has been so many
progress in the last few days (netplay and usb keyboard support).\
\
Of course betatesters do not sit still either, since **Monster Hunter**
is not the only game which supports online gaming. We have tried to find
other games supporting netplay as well.\
By comparing the list of netplay capable games (
[wiki!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_PlayStation_2_network_games)
) with our PCSX2 compatibility list, we found that the game **XIII**
would be a good candidate.\
The game itself is fully playable at reasonable speeds in the single
player mode.\
\
Trying our luck with the same dev9 plugin (netplay) did not give us the
results we hoped for. Authentication went smooth however account
creation kept failing over and over again.\
\
Fortunately **gigaherz** and **drkIIRaziel** worked together trying to
solve this issue. After the plugin was rewritten they managed to fix the
problem.\
\
(hmm\... that deathmatch versus drkIIRaziel went not the way as I hoped
😛 )
