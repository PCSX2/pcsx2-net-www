It seems like our developers are on steroids, there has been so many
progress in the last few days (netplay and usb keyboard support).

Of course betatesters do not sit still either, since **Monster Hunter**
is not the only game which supports online gaming. We have tried to find
other games supporting netplay as well.
By comparing the list of netplay capable games (
[wiki!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_PlayStation_2_network_games)
) with our PCSX2 compatibility list, we found that the game **XIII**
would be a good candidate.
The game itself is fully playable at reasonable speeds in the single
player mode.

Trying our luck with the same dev9 plugin (netplay) did not give us the
results we hoped for. Authentication went smooth however account
creation kept failing over and over again.

Fortunately **gigaherz** and **drkIIRaziel** worked together trying to
solve this issue. After the plugin was rewritten they managed to fix the
problem.

(hmm... that deathmatch versus drkIIRaziel went not the way as I hoped
ðŸ˜› )
