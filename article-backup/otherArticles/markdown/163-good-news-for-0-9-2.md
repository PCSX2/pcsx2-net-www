We have recently had **saqib** and **gigaherz** working very hard on
some\... parts of pcsx2 and its plugins, the result? it should be rather
enjoyable for you when we release 0.9.2!\
\
I\'m not going to tell you what it is, I\'m sure you die hard fans will
all guess from this sound clip

\
**Note:** The sound is a little choppy, but this is due to not running
it at quite full speed, plus background recording of the audio.\
\
A big well done to **saqib** and **gigaherz** !\
