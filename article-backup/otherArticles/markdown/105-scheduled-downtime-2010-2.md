## [Scheduled downtime](/105-scheduled-downtime-2010-2.html) {#scheduled-downtime .contentheading}

Our server will be under maintenance, so we can reorganize the way it is
set up, upgrade our OS and fix stuff here and there
☺️\
We hope downtime will only be for tomorrow October 18th and the day
after, the 19th but these things have a habit of going horribly wrong so
no promises!\
Note that this includes our forum.\
\
Sorry for the inconvenience, but we hope the changes will make the site
and forums faster and more efficient
☺️\

\* update \*\
Falc: Website and forums should be up and running! There might still be
minor issues, don\'t forget to report them in:
