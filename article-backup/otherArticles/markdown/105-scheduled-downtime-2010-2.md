## [Scheduled downtime](/105-scheduled-downtime-2010-2.html) {#scheduled-downtime .contentheading}

Our server will be under maintenance, so we can reorganize the way it is
set up, upgrade our OS and fix stuff here and there
ðŸ˜Š
We hope downtime will only be for tomorrow October 18th and the day
after, the 19th but these things have a habit of going horribly wrong so
no promises!
Note that this includes our forum.

Sorry for the inconvenience, but we hope the changes will make the site
and forums faster and more efficient
ðŸ˜Š

Falc: Website and forums should be up and running! There might still be
minor issues, don't forget to report them in:
