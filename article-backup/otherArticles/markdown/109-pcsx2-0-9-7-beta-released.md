## [PCSX2 0.9.7 beta released!](/109-pcsx2-0-9-7-beta-released.html) {#pcsx2-0.9.7-beta-released .contentheading}

After more than a year since the last stable 0.9.6 release and 8 months
since the last beta release of PCSX2, the new beta version is finally
ready!\
The most notable change is the all new GUI powered by wxWidgets, but the
amount of improvements in this release is really amazing
☺️\
\
This 0.9.7 release is marked as unstable/beta, meaning it still has some
known bugs and unimplemented features but it is fully supported by the
PCSX2 team. For more info, check the included readme file.\
\
Without further delay, here\'s the extensive changelog:

-   New GUI based on wxWidgets working on a separate thread
-   microVU, an all new VU0/VU1/COP2 recompiler
-   VIF rewritten and a new Vif Unpack recompiler
-   IPU improvements, many more videos now play perfectly
-   Stable full screen operation with GSdx
-   Alt+Enter Hotkey for real-time fullscreen/window mode switching
-   Many new emulation options, complete with tooltips
-   New MTGS, much more efficient and compatible
-   New BIOS skipping method, more compatible and correct
-   New Host File System Support
-   Turbo/Slow motion settings for the frame limiter
-   On the fly changing of settings and plugins
-   Threaded Saving/Loading states, so it does not pause gameplay
-   Built in ISO reader with a recently used ISO list
-   Suspend / Resume emulation safely and fast

    Turismo 4 etc)

    Vista / Windows 7 permission issues

    \"cheats\" folder and enabled/disabled from pcsx2\'s file-menu
-   Many important plugin updates, GSdx has many bugs and memory leaks
    fixed, SPU2-X makes dozens of games boot which never did before
