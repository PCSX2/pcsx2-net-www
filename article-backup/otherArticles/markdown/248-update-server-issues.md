As most of you know by now we recently upgraded our server to a faster
one, with more space, a much faster processor and more RAM.

After upgrading we've been having several issues with incomplete
downloads and 500 server errors due to either a bug in FastCGI or some
very weird configuration issue (we still haven't figured it out). We
will attempt to fix it by using some alternative to FastCGI today, so
you should expect some downtime on both our website and our forum.

Thanks for your patience

Edit: Everything is back online, should feel quite faster too
