**Nachbrenner** made this video from ingame on Tekken 4. Game looks very
good, with only slight graphics issues which rarely occur.

Video is **WMV** using Windows Media codec, so you will need a media
player capable of playing back this format. This file is being shared
using **Bit Torrent** , so you will need a torrent client, such as
[uTorrent](http://www.utorrent.com/) to download this video.
