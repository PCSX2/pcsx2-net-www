## [PCSX2/Mac - Release update!](/113-pcsx2-mac-release-update.html) {#pcsx2mac---release-update .contentheading}

It\'s that time of the year again, so i had some time to work on
pcsx2/mac, now with nice sound as well
😉 This update is about solving the missing
textures problem that has been plaguing pcsx2/mac for ages.\
\
The new build is as always available [here](http://pcsx2mac.net/) . In
other news, i\'m putting a mac plugin repository up at
[](http://pcsx2mac.net/downloads/)
[pcsx2mac.net/downloads](http://pcsx2mac.net/downloads/) which will
contain links to .dmg files with all available mac plugins, check it
out.\
\
Zerospu2 0.4.6 has been ported to mac using cross-platform Portaudio
library, i recommend all users to use it
😊\
\
Zeydlitz has recently worked on z-buffer swizzling for the ZZOgl plugin
and this has fixed a lot of missing textures problems for us. I also
fixed some code in pcsx2 for ffx missing textures. Some shots:\
