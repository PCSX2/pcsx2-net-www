## [Scheduled downtime](/86-scheduled-downtime.html) {#scheduled-downtime .contentheading}

Tomorrow we will be working on the server which means that there will be
some downtime. We\'re planning to change our OS and upgrading some
software.

\
There isn\'t an exact timeline but probably around noon we will start
creating some backups and in the afternoon start with installing the OS.
If no problems occur, we should be back sometime in the evening (CET).\

**update (22/02/2011)**\
- Site and forums should be back up!\
\
**update (23/02/2011)**\
- Apologies for the downtime of today. We had to solve some issues
regarding the database and forums. The problem has been fixed which
should result in faster page loading on the forums (especially the
General Discussion section).\

p.s. Don\'t forget to thank Jake Stine (Air) for his [contribution to
the PCSX2
project](http://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-Air-the-latest-PCSX2-retiree) !
