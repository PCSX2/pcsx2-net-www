## [Possible Downtime](/110-possible-downtime.html) {#possible-downtime .contentheading}

Hey there guys,


Just to let you all know, during the next 7 days there may be a bit of
downtime due to us moving our domain registration over from directnic to
the company our dedicated server is owned by, thus bringing everything
in to one place for easier management (from our perspective).

Apologies in advance for any inconvenience, however the main website and
the forums will be down during this period, but we will try our best to
get the website back up as soon as we can!

Thanks
Refraction

**Update 01/04** : The domain is now across, the main site seems ok
however the forums DNS record isnt working currently, we are working on
this.
For now you can add this to your hosts file located in c:windows
directorysystem32driversetc

77.68.58.124 forums.pcsx2.net

This should give you access again until we get this fixed.

Happy April Fools Day! (btw this isnt an april fool)

**Update 04/04** : All seems to be back up again now! well done
Falcon4ever for spotting my mistake -_- . Welcome back everybody
