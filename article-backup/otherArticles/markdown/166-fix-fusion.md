Work has never stopped since the release of **PCSX2 0.9.1** , in fact it
rarely does
ðŸ˜Š

Refraction has made significant fixes to counters making games much more
stable. For instance, *Final Fantasy X-2* is now stable enough to be
classed as "playable". Disgaea will play story scenes without
freezing, and Resident Evil 4 is much more stable during gameplay!

Saqib has been bustling away with IPU and more and more games are
playing videos without looping or crashing mid-way through playback.
This fixes games such as Grand Theft Auto III, Final Fantasy X and
WipEout Fusion.

Zerofrog, busy as ever, has been fixing vuREC0/1 issues and making those
games that do go 'Ingame' look correct including: Rayman M, Silent
Hill 2, and a personal favorite **WipEout Fusion** .

Saqibs IPU fixes combined with ZeroFrogs work on the graphical issues (I
bugged him to death about this game
ðŸ˜› ) have made **WipEout Fusion** playable! So head
to the [Videos](/demo-videos-screenshots/videos.html) section to watch
this game for the first time running brilliantly on PCSX2, also checkout
the recent *Final Fantasy X-2* Video.
