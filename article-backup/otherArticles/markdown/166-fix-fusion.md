Work has never stopped since the release of **PCSX2 0.9.1** , in fact it
rarely does

Refraction has made significant fixes to counters making games much more
stable. For instance, *Final Fantasy X-2* is now stable enough to be
classed as \"playable\". Disgaea will play story scenes without
freezing, and Resident Evil 4 is much more stable during gameplay!\
\
Saqib has been bustling away with IPU and more and more games are
playing videos without looping or crashing mid-way through playback.
This fixes games such as Grand Theft Auto III, Final Fantasy X and
WipEout Fusion.\
\
Zerofrog, busy as ever, has been fixing vuREC0/1 issues and making those
games that do go \'Ingame\' look correct including: Rayman M, Silent
Hill 2, and a personal favorite **WipEout Fusion** .\
\
Saqibs IPU fixes combined with ZeroFrogs work on the graphical issues (I
bugged him to death about this game
![Razz](https://pcsx2.net/images/stories/frontend/smilies/tongue.gif){.yvSmiley

to the [Videos](/demo-videos-screenshots/videos.html) section to watch
this game for the first time running brilliantly on PCSX2, also checkout
the recent *Final Fantasy X-2* Video.\
