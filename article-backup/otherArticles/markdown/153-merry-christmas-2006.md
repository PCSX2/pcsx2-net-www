Merry Christmas folks!

Hope you all have a fantastic day, and get what you want (car,
girlfriend / boyfriend, computer, 1000 games, mint rare copy of Final
Fantasy 7, the one where Aeris lives, hooker...etc, well atleast
they're all cheaper than a PS3, and available in more countries
ðŸ˜‰ )

If you don't celebrate christmas, well Merry Monday to you all!
