North America goes **ingame** !

Thanks to some recent work by *Refraction* and a new contributor
*ZeroFrog* , we can now walk around the first demo area of this game.
Given this is **VERY** early work in progress (W.I.P), there are some
major bugs to be ironed out, like various graphical issues!

However to celebrate this breakthrough, there is a video and several
screens, and be sure to check out the official forums for some
up-and-coming new shots, progress and general discussion!

This video is a **AVI** (Xvid) and should be playable under any decent
media player and is being shared using **Bit Torrent** , thus you will
need a Bit Torrent client such as [uTorrent](http://www.utorrent.com/)
to get this video!

Final Fantasy XII Demo - Ingame
53 Seconds | 38.2MB | Real Ingame Speed - 6 FPS.

This video is being shared through Bit Torrent, we ask if you could seed
(share) this file for as long as possible!
