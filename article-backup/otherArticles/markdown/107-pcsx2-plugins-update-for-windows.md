## [PCSX2 plugins update for Windows!](/107-pcsx2-plugins-update-for-windows.html) {#pcsx2-plugins-update-for-windows .contentheading}

Hey guys!\
We\'ve made some important changes to **GSdx** and **SPU2-X** concerning
bugfixes, stability, and emulation correctness. It\'s best to use these
with the PCSX2 0.9.7.r3113 beta release.\
\
Head over to the [**beta downloads
section**](/download/viewcategory/35-pcsx2-v0-9-7-beta.html) to grab the
7z archive with the upgraded plugins. To upgrade, extract into your
PCSX2 plugins folder and then select them from PCSX2\'s plugin
selector.\
\
GSdx changes:

-   Better DirectX 11 detection.
-   Wrong colors in the movie record feature fixed.
-   More CRCs for automatic post process removal.
-   Stability fixes and preparation work for future PCSX2 revisions.
-   Finally fixed the remaining DirectX 11 memory leaks on emulator
    suspends!

SPU2-X changes:

-   Major bugfix that prevented SPU2-X from initializing on many users
    systems.
-   More accurate emulation regarding double interrupts.
-   Fixed minor volume issues and doubled output volume.
-   Fixed a write-back issue that had caused memory corruption before.\
    Now the Tales of Destiny 2 sound test has a working visual
    equalizer.
-   Mostly fixed voice modulation (used in Romancing Saga and FFX
    battles).
-   Clamp illegal pitch settings, fixing another bunch of games.
-   Hopefully fixed bad reverb area problems.

Enjoy
