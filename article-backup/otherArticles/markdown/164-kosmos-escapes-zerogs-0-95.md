**ZeroGS KOSMOS 0.95** written by **Zerofrog** is out! This is *the*
plugin of choice for people using graphics cards supporting Pixel Shader
2.0 or 3.0.

ZeroGS KOSMOS has greatly improved over its previous release, now it is
**significantly faster** , an example would be 'Final Fantasy XII',
which is now 3x faster ingame!

Less graphical flaws are present with many games looking absolutely
stunning, and even the least capable PS2.0 supporting cards, such as the
nVidia 5xxx series will show little to no loss in quality.

ZeroGS KOSMOS also supports the MTGS (Multi Threaded GS) feature of
PCSX2, this allows users with Dual Core or Multi CPU machines to get
even more speed out of PCSX2, however until the next release of PCSX2,
the current MTGS issues will persist.

ZeroGS KOSMOS supports various new features including video recording,
Bilinear Filtering, 2 and 4xAA, wireframe mode and more!

Note that the newest [**DirectX
Runtime**](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=35) is
required to run ZeroGS KOSMOS.

**Final Edit:** All ATI issues have been solved along with other minor
bugs. If experiencing any problems, try redownloading (there are a
couple of versions of 0.95.2 out there).
