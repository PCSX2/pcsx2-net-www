Just a quick one, now i'm not suffering so badly from post traumatic
release disorder, I thought I better just make a note saying to you guys
the release builds were updated yesterday (if you didn't realize there
was edit's) due to a bug making the TLB release extremely slow. This
has now been fixed.

I have just updated the packs again to include Linuz ISO plugin version
0.7.0, seems we accidentally packed 0.6.0 with the earlier builds! sorry
about that!

If you already have the slowness bug fixes (or you only use VM), you can
download the Linuz ISO plugin update from our plugin downloads section,
else feel free to redownload the packs, preferably from the mirror, as
some of you may have noticed due to the volume of downloads we had, the
site was grinding to a halt!

Thanks and enjoy 0.9.4

PS: Guide to getting online coming soon (a proper one). As linked in the
last post there is a simple guide with the basic steps you need to take
in order to get up and running, but i will do a more detailed one later
for those who don't quite understand
