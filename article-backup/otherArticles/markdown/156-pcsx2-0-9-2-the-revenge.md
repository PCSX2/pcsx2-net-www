**PCSX2 0.9.2 R2** is now available\
\
This fixes an assortment of issues found briefly after 0.9.2\'s original
launch. It is **strongly** advised that people get this build of 0.9.2
over the initial release.

-   Compatibility regression with **Vampire Night** resolved.
-   **Final Fantasy X** now works for *most* regions.
-   Fixes Crash when using *config\>patches*
-   Frame Limiting is now more accurate.
-   Improved zeroGS, **Disgaea 2** menus are now solid.
-   P.E.Op.S SPU2 updated to include threaded mode (useful for video
    recording).
-   Screen Saver / Power Saving now disabled when running PCSX2.

\
Just to cure our collective headaches \"warnings about default.xml\"
being blank, or \"patches not found\", are merely information, they do
**not** in any way effect PCSX2\'s compatibility or performance.\
\
If the *config\>patches* crash problem persists, grab the updated exe\'s
[here](/download/viewcategory/34-pcsx2-v0-9-2.html) .\
\
We are releasing via torrent and http, **please** seed for as long as
possible with the torrents, we recommend
[uTorrent](http://www.utorrent.com/) as a client!\
