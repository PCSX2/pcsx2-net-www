It's that time of the year again and since everyone else is off
drink...celebrating, I'm the only one left around to wish all our
visitors and users a Merry Christmas for 2012
ðŸ˜Š

As you all can see development has been sluggish after the huge 1.0.0
release (as it always happens after releases) but there are still new
stuff to look out for. So since the release of 1.0.0 here is a breakdown
of most of the changes on PCSX2 itself and its plugins:

-   Various SPU2-X fixes for crashes/hanging in some games
-   Snowblind engine fix (Baldur's Gate etc) which also fixed Mortal
    Kombat Shaolin Monks. Keep in mind Baldur's Gate games only work in
    software mode for now and with various bugs still (we are getting
    there...)
-   Adapter selector in GSdx so you can select your dedicated graphics
    card instead of that pesky on board graphics chip
-   Videos finally working for Katamari Damacy, Baldur's Gate, Tales of
    Destiny 2, Suikoden Tactics, Midnight Club,Guilty Gear XX Accent
    Core Plus, Ace Combat games and probably many more
-   Various fixes here and there

The website also got its share of fixes, with various layout fixes, a
much nicer looking video gallery under Demo, random screenshot on index
page really random (
ðŸ˜› ) and more functionality on the compatibility
list. I am planning on adding some very handy features to it soon, which
are still under development but I'm sure most will appreciate them!

Our community has also been very active, with many members coding tools
