I finally got around updated the configuration guide for the 1.2.1
release with all the new features and also adding some new plugins that
most people don\'t know about
☺️ You can check it out
[here](/config-guide/official-english-pcsx2-configuration-guide.html) as
usual and you can find instructions on translating it to your language
[here.](http://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-Translator-template-1-2-1)

I have also updated our netplay plugin **DEV9giga-razi** to include the
latest fixes brought by two contributors in Git,
[MrColdbird](https://github.com/MrColdbird) and
[Bigpet](https://github.com/Bigpet) whom we thank for their nice
contributions. The plugin should crash much rarer than it did before, so
we hope it will be usable for those who couldn\'t run it. You can get it
at our [windows plugins download
section](/download/viewcategory/9-plugins.html) .\
\
Finally, thanks to a lot of contributions from forum members
(DESTRUIDOR,JBoughter,Altomar and many others), our compatibility list
has been updated and expanded, so [take a
look](/compatibility-list.html) to check if your game is working in the
latest PCSX2 version and nice settings for it to get around its
problems.
