Hey people, I thought this was worth mentioning

\
Orphis was so kind to set up and operate a build bot for PCSX2 SVN
snapshots.\
\
The bot takes the latest sources as we commit them and builds working
packages for you to download.\
These packages are /trunk builds and Win32 only (for now).\
\
The bot is here:\
<http://buildbot.orphis.net/pcsx2/>\
\
Thanks again to Orphis for providing this nice service!\
\
**Note:** Discussions of SVN builds on our forums is allowed as long as
you\'re using official SVN builds (not hacked/modified 3rd party
builds).\
We encourage bug reports to be made using the latest SVN build.
