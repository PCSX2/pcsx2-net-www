## [SVN snapshots (build bot)](/83-svn-snapshots-build-bot.html) {#svn-snapshots-build-bot .contentheading}

Hey people, I thought this was worth mentioning
ðŸ˜Š

Orphis was so kind to set up and operate a build bot for PCSX2 SVN
snapshots.

The bot takes the latest sources as we commit them and builds working
packages for you to download.
These packages are /trunk builds and Win32 only (for now).

The bot is here:
<http://buildbot.orphis.net/pcsx2/>

Thanks again to Orphis for providing this nice service!

**Note:** Discussions of SVN builds on our forums is allowed as long as
you're using official SVN builds (not hacked/modified 3rd party
builds).
We encourage bug reports to be made using the latest SVN build.
