I tried to think of a flashy title for this, but i couldn\'t, so I
thought I\'d just blurt it out!

Yes the IPU (video side of PCSX2) has been updated by none other than
**Saqib** ! You might be asking what this will bring to the table? Well
im sure as many of you know, videos in PCSX2 suffered from Macroblocking
(Corrupt squares appearing all over the place) or videos freezing
randomly. Well thanks to Saqib for his marvelous work, many games no
longer suffer from these symptoms. Here is a quick rundown of some of
the games fixed.\
\
Atelier Iris - Grand Phantasm\
Ayumi Hamasaki - A Visual Mix\
Bully\
Graffiti Kingdom\
Many Growlanser games\
Monster Hunter\
Resident Evil 4\
Simple Series Videos\
Soul Calibur 3\
The Simpsons\
Many more!\
\
In light of these changes a lot of games have been improved to a
playable status or had their stability increased!\
\
The code is in SVN, do NOT ask for help on the forums. If you guys are
lucky, i might be nice enough to compile a new beta very soon
😉\
