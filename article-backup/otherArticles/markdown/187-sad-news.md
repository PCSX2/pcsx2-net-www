**Linuzappz** the lead coder for the *PCSX2* project has 'officially'
quit. This is due to several reasons, from slowly losing interest in the
project, to simply not having enough time to work on it.

I won't pull punches here, this *is* a major blow to this project as he
is responsible for so much code, plugins and has an extensive knowledge
of the **PlayStation 2** . Whilst he will pop in 'rarely' to lend a
hand, or some advice he won't be working on it further

All of the betatesting team, his fellow developers and the general
people who lend help in **#PCSX2** will greatly miss him. We send him
all our best, wish him luck with his hectic life and lets hope he gets
at least one date with **Carolina Ardoh√°in (Pampita)**

**PCSX2** is far from dead and both **shadow** , **Saqib** will maintain
the project with the heap of coders we do have (Refraction, auMatt,
GoldFinger etc..)
![Confused](https://pcsx2.net/images/stories/frontend/smilies/unsure.gif){.yvSmiley
width="20" height="20"} Given this project has come so far just recently
we won't be letting it go the way of the dodo.
