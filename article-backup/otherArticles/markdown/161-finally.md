Current WIP on the PCSX2 0.9.2 beta has led to the PAL (SCES 5049x)
version of Final Fantasy X being **Playable** . Thanks to a variety of
fixes made by various members of the team, including;

-   MTGS / DC mode stability - Great for Dual Core / CPU users!
-   IPU fixes, including fully working sound in videos
-   Pause and sync issues, no more random hangs, looping etc
-   SPU2 fixes, including ADMA, and timing related issues.

With MTGS (Multi Threaded GS) / DC (Dual Core) features gaining improved
stability, the game can be played at 'enjoyable' speeds, ranging from
a base speed of 29 FPS in the most intense areas, right up to the peak
speeds of over 140 FPS.[1]

This means that the US, Japanese and *finally* the European versions of
Final Fantasy X are fully playable!

Enjoy the shots posted on the PCSX2 official forums!
