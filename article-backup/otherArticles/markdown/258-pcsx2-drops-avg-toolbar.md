This news post comes at an awkward moment, but AVG sent a letter a while
ago stating they were terminating our partnership, and this termination
has now become effective. Because of that, we have uploaded an unbundled
version of the latest release installer, which you can find in our
downloads section.\
\
We would like to thank those users who have provided us with donations
and supported us through our bundled toolbar. They have been essential
in ensuring the team can afford the things required to improve the
emulator and keep everything up and running.

\
Thank you all for the support so far!
