Hey people.
While we're still working on the new PCSX2 version, we've also been
constantly adding to the all important plugins.
Every now and then we release a beta plugin pack, so you can test them
out and benefit from the new features a bit earlier
ðŸ˜Š
Head over to the beta downloads page
[**here**](/download/viewcategory/35-pcsx2-v0-9-7-beta.html) to grab the
new March 2010 package.

SPU2-X 1.4:

-   Yet again improved sound quality by fixing a sample overflow in the
    ADPCM decoder.
-   Adjustable reverb volume, for deeper reverb effects.
-   Fixes to interrupts and status registers that allow many more games
    to boot.
    **Games fixed by this update include titles like Fatal Frame 2 and
    3, Black, the Burnout series, Max Payne 2, Silent Hill 0rigins,
    Silent Hill Shattered Memories and, of course, "Disney Princess:
    Enchanted Journey"**
    ðŸ˜›


GSdx 0.1.16:

-   Stability fixes (less exception crashes).
-   More games have post processing removed, making them playable.
-   Fixed a blending effect used in Final Fantasy 10, 10-2 and Grandia3.

    version.

And many more..
