## [Server upgrade](/118-server-upgrade.html) {#server-upgrade .contentheading}

On July 25th, we will be performing maintenance to our dedicated server.
The server will be taken down at 11:00 CET. This means that the frontend
and the forums will be offline.

Scheduled tasks:
- Site backup (This could take a couple of hours)
- Fresh install of Ubuntu (This could take a couple of hours)
- Restore the forums (less than one hour)
- Restore the frontend (less than one hour)

If no problems occur, the server should be back online at the end of the
day (CET).

***edit 26th - 21:20 CET***
And we're back online!

It took a bit longer than expected (blame ref
ðŸ˜› ) but hopefully everything is working now.

Cheers,
- Falc.
