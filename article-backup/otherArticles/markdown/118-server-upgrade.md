## [Server upgrade](/118-server-upgrade.html) {#server-upgrade .contentheading}

On July 25th, we will be performing maintenance to our dedicated server.
The server will be taken down at 11:00 CET. This means that the frontend
and the forums will be offline.\
\
Scheduled tasks:\
- Site backup (This could take a couple of hours)\
- Fresh install of Ubuntu (This could take a couple of hours)\
- Restore the forums (less than one hour)\
- Restore the frontend (less than one hour)\
\
If no problems occur, the server should be back online at the end of the
day (CET).\
\

\
**\*edit 26th - 21:20 CET\***\
And we\'re back online!\
\
It took a bit longer than expected (blame ref
![Razz](https://pcsx2.net/images/stories/frontend/smilies/tongue.gif){.yvSmiley

\
Cheers,\
- Falc.
