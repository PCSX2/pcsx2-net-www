# Statement on and Rules Against Piracy

The act of illegally obtaining or redistributing copyrighted works ("piracy") – as well as encouraging, facilitating, or discussing such an act – is strictly disallowed on the PCSX2 Discord, the PCSX2 Forums, the PCSX2 Wiki, the PCSX2 GitHub repository, or any other platform which is maintained primarily by the PCSX2 Project (an "official platform").

All users of the PCSX2 emulator seeking support from or to contribute via an official platform are expected to own a legally obtained copy of any game which they play, and they are additionally expected to own a Sony PlayStation 2 BIOS dumped from a Sony PlayStation 2 device which they own. If it is discovered by the PCSX2 Team that a member of an official platform has obtained either of these through piracy, they will be flagged as a pirate and barred from receiving any form of support on official platforms until such a time as they can prove they legally own both. Any member of an official platform found to be facilitating piracy _or_ helping a known pirate to use the PCSX2 emulator will be banned indefinitely from said platform.

PCSX2 is not designed to facilitate illegal activity. Before using PCSX2, users are strongly encouraged to review the relevant copyright laws of the jurisdiction in which they reside.
